In addition, through implementation of the School-wide Enrichment Model, the faculty and staff have played an integral part in providing sustainable arts programming based on student-interest in clusters such as “Art for Change,” “Photography,” “Making Music” and “Trash to Treasure”. 
We continued residency programs with organizations such as The Children's Museum of Art, Mark DeGarmo Dance and Third Street Music, in which kindergarten through fifth grade students learned through the Orff Shulwerk approach. Students explored basic rhythms/melodies using various instruments. 
All our students visited arts museums, films and performances to supplement and extend arts learning objectives grown out of classroom curriculum. We continued our nine-year relationship with Arts for All, Inc, providing our kindergarten through second grade students with opportunities to integrate theater and visual art into literacy. Our students have many opportunities to express themselves through dance, music, and theater with our partnerships with Mark DeGarmo Dance, Rosie’s Broadway Kids, puppetry with Arts Connection and creative storytelling with Story Pirates. Lastly, through our Technology Arts class, students study mentor artists, learn coding, graphic design, and animation. We expect to have many submissions to this year’s District 1 Arts Fair and close the year on a high note for Arts at PS 15!",,Rosemary Camera,Arts Education Liaison and Schoolwide Enrichment Coordinator,rcamera@schools.nyc.gov

We look forward to building on the addition of the visual arts program through the Arts Matters initiative this past year. We expect that this initiative will inspire and encourage students to gain skills and confidence through art and galleries. In addition, we will continue to enhance our school environment and culture by encouraging performances and displays that not only celebrate the talents of our students but also create more of a connection and understanding of the various units of study in different curriculum areas. We currently and consistently have student work on display throughout our school building. This enables students to support each other and gain respect for each others work and skills.

To accomplish this, we strive to secure funding for arts resources and opportunities for our Pre-K, Elementary and Middle School students.   Our 2016-17 CBO arts partners include Studio in a School, LEAP, Marquis Studios, Rosie's Theatre Kids, Disney Musicals in School, SEA, and more! 

We believe that the arts provide a unique entry point into academics.  With this in  mind, we collaborate with these CBOs to implement arts-infused curricula in core subject areas, as well as to provide skills-based arts instruction.   PS/MS 188 is designated a NYC DOE  Showcase School.  Our Technology/Media Arts program has been highlighted at our regularly held Open Houses for NYC DOE educators and administrators, and commended by Chancellor Farina.  

We believe that the arts provide meaningful pathways for success to and in high school, and beyond. Using Renzulli's School-wide Enrichment/Talent Development Model, we provide students with a comprehensive range of experiences in the Arts:  Type I (Exposure & Exploration); Type II (Skills Development); Type III (Application of Skills to Real-Life Situations).  The arts at PS/MS 188 greatly enrich our student's lives, and provide inspiration and pathways for our students when they move on to secondary school.   As importantly, the arts contribute greatly to our vibrant school culture.","Our school enrollment is approximately 97% Title 1 eligible, with disproportionately 
high representation of student groups most at risk:  47% of our students live in temporary housing (2nd highest percent across NYC public schools); 33% are classified as Students with Disabilities; 28% are English Language Learners; 66% are Latino and 32% are African American.  

The arts play a vital role in engaging our students both during the regular school day and in extended day programming, and contribute dramatically to our vibrant school culture.",Alice Schiller,Arts Liaison,alice.schiller@gmail.com

Through these vital programs, students have a chance to collaborate with professional artists in residency-based programs. 

Field trips are integral to our work and curriculum at the Neighborhood School.  Teachers work closely with educators and teaching artists at a range of museums and cultural institutions throughout NYC.  Teachers plan trips connected with studies in all academic and artistic areas.  Throughout their time at TNS, students will likely visit the Whitney, Museum of the City of New York, the NY Historical Society, MOMA, the Met, Studio Museum, NMAI, and many more.  We are a partnership school with the New Victory Theater.

Curriculum at The Neighborhood School is multi-disciplinary and project-based.  Students have a chance to collaborate on arts-based culminating projects.  Additionally, all students take part in Project Time in their classrooms or in the Makers' Space multiple times per week.  Project Time is a time in which students choose, design, plan, and execute a project of their own design.  Examples include projects in film, animation, robotics, painting, printmaking, wood-working, sewing, blocks, and more.",,Alexis Neider,arts liaison,alexis@tnsny.org

MUSIC: The Music Program focuses on instrumental music. Students
explore the elements of music – rhythm, melody and harmony through the study of piano. Critical listening skills are developed through exposure to a variety of musical styles including classical, jazz, rock and world music.  Music Majors choose a string instrument – violin, viola, cello or guitar to deepen their study of music at a higher level and give live performances in and out of school.
The Visual Arts program at MS 131 serves a diverse student body comprised of SPED, ELL, and GenEd students in a 3-year, a sequential curriculum designed to prepare students for entrance into specialized arts high schools throughout New York City. Throughout the 3-year art program, students visit art galleries and show their own work in semi-annual art gallery shows, as well as throughout the year in classrooms, hallways and even the MoMA and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, this year. 
Dance Education Program is dedicated to developing dancers that are interested in developing exceptional dance artists. The dance curriculum is designed to create strong technical dancers where skill and confidence are acquired along with a passion for the performing arts. Students develop as professional dance artists, critical thinkers, problem solvers, choreographers, teachers, leaders, and individuals.

It is located on the third and fourth floor of a building situated on the Lower East Side of Manhattan adjacent to the Chinatown community. Our diverse student body is drawn from students who have chosen to attend Cascades High School after having experienced difficulty adjusting to the traditional learning environment found in other New York City Comprehensive High Schools. The shared commonality for all of our students is that they are over age and under-credited and want to complete requirements for a high school diploma.
The student body is served by 21 full time professionals and support staff, including one (1) principal, (1) assistant principal, (12) teachers, (1) guidance counselor, (1) secretary, (1) computer technician, (1) parent coordinator and (3) school aides. Of the 12 teachers on staff, 42% have more than 5 years teaching experience, and 75% hold a Master’s Degree.

Visual arts, music and theatre classes engage students in a wide range of learning.  Our visual arts curriculum includes exploration of different art forms while incorporating a study of famous artists.  The music curriculum includes instruction in instrumental performance (keyboard, xylophone and recorder) as well as instruction in reading music. Our theatre arts program provides students with experience in acting and play writing. Enrichment periods are scheduled to provide additional opportunities in arts learning.  To prepare students for 21st century learning, our students use their individual ipad apps to create iMovies, keynote for presentations as well as pages for poster presentations.  These are integrated into all content areas of the curriculum - reading, writing, social studies and science.  This is our second year with the Abrons Art Center at Henry Street Settlement.  This year's focus has been on theatre and dance for our students, prek through 1st grade.  National Dance Institute continues their 30 year history at P.S. 2 teaching our 5th graders.

Art lessons are developmentally appropriate experiences that encourage children to reflect and communicate about themselves and the world around them.  
The philosophy of our visual arts program, emphasizes that all our students are potential artists who view the world from their own unique perspectives.  Their experiences of living in the world are communicated through explorations with different arts materials in drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, and sculpture. Our program inspires students to explore a variety of processes and techniques for self expression and communication. Children are encouraged to work independently as well as in collaborative group settings at all grade levels.   
All art lessons are aligned with the NYC Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts at each benchmark level, the New York State Learning Standards for the Arts and the National Visual Arts Standards. Projects and themes are structured to support the philosophies and perspectives of other disciplines such as math, literacy, science, social studies, language arts and technology.","PS 33 has students in grades PK-5 and is proud to host a diverse community of learners. We work collaboratively to maintain the remarkable achievement that has become the norm for our students. It is home to a rich, standards based curriculum that fosters analytical thinking, creativity, and independence. We use a wide range of resources to provide an holistic and challenging academic program while fostering a welcoming school community. As evidenced through the data here, the school strives to make many and varied connections for all our students by utilizing the vast array of out of school arts and cultural organizations available to public school students in NYC.
Student artwork, art reproductions, picture books and technology are incorporated to assist in achieving the goals of the art program at our school. The artistic development of each child is a blueprint for how we approach the growth of the individual in the classroom experience.  
The art classroom studio provides children a rare and valuable opportunity to express visually their unique feelings, thoughts, and perspectives. Extended time in a studio environment allows for experiences where students can take the time to experiment and create at a developmentally appropriate pace to their needs.  Children learn best when their learning matters to them – when it’s connected to their lives and experiences – and filled with wonder, joy and fun!",Karin Dando-Haenisch,Art Teacher/Liasion,kdandohaenisch@gmail.com

Our comprehensive program includes our in-house music and art programs and an arts residency program for every child from Pre-K through Grade 5. Many of our arts partnership programs offer scholarships to students who show a particular interest or talent in a discipline and also provide opportunities for them to continue after they leave PS 130. In addition to our day school offerings, we also have many free school-sponsored after school programs such as a competitive fife and drum corps, a school chorus, a ballroom dance club, and a Chinese lion dance club.

week. Additionally, band students participate in concerts as well as borough-wide band shows and performances at Carnegie Hall. This year, the senior band visited the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT, attended their concert and had lessons or ""clinic"" with the Coast Guard band members and their conductor. A
number of students, from 6th to 8th grade, have auditioned and been accepted into Manhattan Borough-Wide Band and Inter-City Band as well as the National Children's Chorus. Non-band students
participate in a rotating program of theatre and visual arts. The visual and theatre arts students follow the NYC Blueprint for the Arts and an alignment to the Common Core Standards. Activities in the theatre and visual arts program include but are not limited to art studio,drama club, museum club, dance performances, digital photography, winter and spring concerts, and a school-wide celebration of learning. Some of our students have been accepted into summer art intensives at Frank Sinatra School for the Arts.

This year, for the first time in many, we have a full time certified art teacher,and a certified full time music teacher. New this year was 3 rotations of Middle School arts clubs (based on student choice) which included film appreciation, 3D art, and band. Our long term (14 weeks and more) residency programs included Salvadori for Urban Design (MS) Landmarks, Memorials and Monuments, Music Together for PreK&K, Studio in A School for G4, Musical Theater from Wingspan & Main Street Theater for Grades 4&5, and African Dance from Main Street Theater for G3. Other grades participated in Hip Hop, Yoga/Movement, Ballroom Dance, Greek Architecture and Studio classes.  Additionally, we celebrated the arts with 3 Family Art Sat. and evening Workshops.
Unique to our building is our partnership with Cornell Tech Graduate School that has provided and supported arts learning through a year long residency program in computer science, that included several hack-a-thons for animation and game design and maker space events for a variety of design and arts projects. We continue our collaboration with the Main Street Theater and Dance Alliance, our own Roosevelt Island local arts community center.
We provided art for 10 G levels with 2 residency programs per
grade plus visual arts instruction and music through certified staff this year, hopefully, funding from our school budget and our parents through the PTA will enable us to do so again for 2017/2018 school year.","We are a PreK to 8 grade school on Roosevelt Island.
We are a diverse community of learners who speak over 17 different languages from over 30 countries who are in general education, special education and gifted and talented classrooms.

The first unit of Visual Art, “Art Begins With a Mystery"", provides students with experiences uncovering and expressing ideas through visual imagery. In Theater, students begin by learning about storytelling, uncovering the deep connections between design thinking and artistic creativity. Visual Art offers students the opportunity to develop strategies and techniques for making 2D visual art; including proficiency with line and weight, shape and form, value, color, and perspective. In the later half of the class students will practice and refine these skills in independent works, and explore the social and historical context of various artistic expressions. Theater encourages students to extend their expressive and interpersonal skills, building their work in other classes by developing their confidence and comfort presenting to an audience of their peers. Throughout the latter half of the class, students will explore more sophisticated areas of performance, with options ranging from clowning and comedy to the writing, performance, and analysis of Hip Hop poetry. Students will engage with art and art making both in and out of the classroom. They will be expected to produce exhibitions of their own work as well as portfolios of their growth. They will engage artists, art makers, and art spaces in public and community settings in order to explore careers in the arts.",,Benjamin August,Arts Liason,Baugust3@schools.nyc.gov

Our seniors participate in our annual Choosing to Participate exhibit which combines intense research on a social justice issue and the creation of an art activism piece displayed at the end of the year celebration. Our partnership has provided opportunity and access for all of our students both academically and artistically.",,Dana Panagot,Principal,dpanagot@schools.nyc.gov

To supplement our Studio Arts program, we engaged with LEAP, an outside arts organization, to bring in a professional artist two days a week into our school. As such, all art students participated in a series of painting and printmaking projects that introduced to them the broader professional art world.

We use sketchbooks for planning, work with peers to give and receive feedback, and share work during frequent class gallery walks. While we value the experience of creating artwork the most, we also celebrate the learning and final product during our elaborate Spring Art Show. 

The music program at PS 527 provides engaging experiences that are appropriately aligned to NYC Blueprints for the Arts to teach the fundamentals of music. In weekly music classes, children are creating, singing, and performing on instruments. Classes also function as choral ensembles that rehearse for and perform multiple concerts annually. Many third-fifth grade students elect to be in the band program, which consists of keyboards, guitars, woodwind, brass and percussion and performs a repertoire that spans from Latin jazz to contemporary pop. Students in grades 2-5 receive music technology training in which they learn to compose and record music using digital audio workstations and notation software. 

In addition to music and visual arts, all students perform in end-of-year theatrical performances, and Grades 1 and 4 learn Dance from NYC Ballet and 92Y.  Many arts-based field trips occur throughout the school year for all grades.",,Daniel McCormick,Principal,dmccormick@schools.nyc.gov

Both the visual arts and music teacher are teaching one semester long fundamentals courses to the 9th grade body.  Due to space constraints, the teachers must share the same room, which simultaneously creates restrictions on materials but also creates a central arts space.  

In music, students learn to play guitar, drums, & keyboard while writing their own music as well as researching music genres. In art, students are learning the fundamentals of drawing, color theory, watercolor paint, and oil pastels while learning about some arts movements and artists.

After school, the music club meets once a week, and students forms small groups or work on individual skills.  With our school being a PROSE school, the visual arts teacher was able to shift her schedule to include an after school art program as part of her regular day three times a week, where students have worked on individual skill, and creating artwork for a summer exhibit.  Once a week, a documentary film maker works with a group of students after school through the CASA grant received in cooperation with South Street Seaport Museum, ending in a screening in June.","New York Harbor School is a public high school for the Maritime and Environmental trades on Governors Island.

Included are architectural design, cartooning, animation, graphic design, illustration, digital photography, film and video, and fashion design. Students learn the Adobe and AutoCAD software programs and become certified in both programs. Our facilities mirror the state of the art equipment used in industry and students participate in internships available through industry partners and various arts organizations. They compete in art competitions and display their artwork both in school and in outside venues. Graduating students are accepted into major colleges and universities throughout the country. All our majors have their own gallery Shows in the Kenny Gallery throughout the year. We also invite industry professionals to address our students and share their expertise with our students during career day and in their studios. Our culminating Spring Arts Festival thoroughly highlights student achievement in the arts and is well-attended by the public and students' families. In addition, our fashion students present a fashion show and the film students showcase their work in their Film Festival.",Students who wish to attend the High School of Art and Design participate in the audition process where they share their portfolios with us and take the audition assessment. Students meet and discuss their portfolios with an art educator during their audition. Acceptance is based on students' talent and commitment to the arts. Our acceptance criteria are posted on our web site for parents and students to review. We do not discriminate based on race or ethnicity.

At the conclusion of their 6th grade year, students participate in a series of auditions and select one of these art forms in which they will specialize over the next two years. Through their three years of middle school our students have multiple opportunities to showcase their art work. 6th graders demonstrate their work four times through the year during morning art exhibitions that are open to families. Our 7th and 8th graders share their work twice a year in evening art showcase and performance exhibitions. In all three years of our arts program students perform multiple times for peers, the school community and the public.

Through those classes our students are exposed to the arts during the school day, but we find that they want and need more, so we have also expanded our arts programs after school. We offer choir, dance, theater, visual arts and film through our after school program, and our students are so engaged in this work. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our arts program so that we can immerse our students in the arts and tap into their many talents.  Every year, more and more of our students are applying and being accepted into high schools that have a focus in the arts such as LaGuardia, Talent Unlimited, PPAS, and Grammercy Arts.","Our dance and performing arts teachers are continuously making connections with outside organizations to bring arts programming to our students.

Students develop a portfolio that embodies their ability to effectively use and analyze media which documents their development as critical thinkers equipped with an understanding of the forces that shape communication.

To foster this vision, the school community has developed a dynamic and well-organized arts program across arts disciplines that is inclusive of our children's backgrounds and of the world's cultures. We are committed to a vision of the school as a community of learners, who are empowered to create their work and share their process. We achieve this vision by the integration of the arts experiences within classroom curriculum and the broad exposure to the arts through our collaborations with neighborhood cultural institutions. Our school is currently in a vertical grade research project with Lincoln Center Institute with the goal of understanding how to implement the capacities for imaginative learning across cohorts.

Within that process, students are able to re-contextualize both narrative and story through their own use of multi-media and performance as well as use art to explore critical issues that are important to them. Each course has three specific performance challenges and one culminating capstone that function as part of a student’s ongoing portfolio. In addition, teachers at IDP collaborate with outside cultural organizations to offer after school programs in Theatre, Spoken Word, Creative Writing, and Video Production. During the 2016-7 school year, IDP produced two full theatre productions and one Spoken Word Performance.  In addition, students were given opportunities  to attend cultural arts events, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Broadway shows.

Students will build a foundation of media and technique through lessons engaging observation and imagination. Our art program will expose students to a variety of artists, art styles, and art vocabulary building dialogue to critically analyze their work and the work of others.

The PS/MS 57 Arts program includes visual, music, theater and dance components. All students receive arts enrichment in these areas. Prekindergarten has music, role-play, poetry and movement as integral components of everyday. K-8th grades infuse poetry, music & art into CCLS-based lessons which are developed by the teachers and instructional teams. In addition to embedded school-based visual arts instruction, we have an Arts partnership with the 92nd Street 'Y' that provides stimulating student experiences through choral training that culminates in a district-wide showcase with several participating schools. 92nd St. Y also engaged students in visual arts, Hip Hop and musical introduction. This year the 'Dancing in the Classrooms' served 5th grade and 'Ballroom Basics' company serves our middle school population. These dance programs culminate in the school's participation in a citywide competition. After-school programs such as the YMCA, Roads to Success, and City Year provide arts exposure via varied dance genres such as hip hop and tap; while the staff enhances support of the arts initiative via after-school chorus, flag corps, step squad and classical music appreciation for K-8th grade students.",,Lorraine Hasty,Principal,LHasty@schools.nyc.gov

We have established partnerships with the Society of Educational Arts and CMA. Currently, we have a visual arts program where students engage in the process of creating graphics using videos and others engage in mask making. The learning includes learning the history behind specific cultures and the meaning of masks for each particular culture. Students learn how to create masks and develop a sense of understanding for each unique culture. The Children's Museum of Arts works with our fourth grade students. Visual arts is infuse in the social studies curriculum. The artist worked hand-in-hand with teachers to integrate the arts in classrooms, using project-based learning to creatively bridge disciplines. Story Pirates provides our students with theatre experience. The idea is that students are engaged in creative writing by planning and visualizing. The actors collect written works from students and adapt these stories for the stage. Kid-written work is then performed by professional actors in a sketch comedy venue.

This school year we added a dance program which is led by the Society of Educational Arts. The dance program provides an opportunity for students to learn technique and dance history.",,Yazmin Perez,Art Supervisor,yperez2@schools.nyc.gov

We also believe that education is a joint venture among students, parents/caregivers and teachers. We see the individual child’s curiosity, abilities and learning styles as integral factors in designing, individualizing and assessing each student’s learning. We believe that the arts are an essential part of the curriculum and that it is important for students to express themselves creatively and to use their imaginations freely. We believe that the uniqueness of children is revealed in their very existence and that it is the school’s responsibility to foster their innate sense of the mystery and joy of life. We encourage children to follow their interests, pursue problems in a way that makes sense to them and defend their conclusion by explaining their thinking a variety of ways. We understand that there are many kinds of intelligence and the traditional academic, cognitive area is one. Other important areas of intelligence are intuition, imagination, artistic creativity, physical expression and performance, sensitivity to others, and self-understanding. To neglect any of these areas is to limit students in the development of their full human potential. We engage students with hands-¬on investigations, projects and design challenges across the grades and subject areas inspiring greater interest, depth and understanding.","Ralph Bunche School Students…

In our 8th grade Design for Life course, many of our students will be visiting the African Dance workshop at BAM. The workshop will allow our students to learn about the Afro-Brazilian style of dance and music. Our 7th grade DFL class has reached out to Harlem Stage. Theater instructors from Harlem Stage worked with our students to create interpretations of excerpts from the Autobiography of Malcolm X. Our 6th grade social studies classes spent this year visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Our students were able to view works of art and historical artifacts that aligned with the early civilizations of the 6th grade curriculum (Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome). During this past school year we partnered with the New York Historical Society and took part in a program called Teen Thursdays. A number of our 7th and 8th grade students experienced the historical society each week and worked with different primary sources that reflected the role of New York in the context of American history.

Engagement in these art disciplines will enhance cultural awareness, promote positive socialization skills, boost self-esteem and positively impact students' capacity in areas such as math, literacy, science, etc. Through participation in these arts programs, students will recognize and engage in the vibrant historical and artistic community of Harlem.  They will also learn about cultural diversity through exposure to music and dances from around the world.

We present our students with a conservatory level of study and weigh offerings in the performing arts equally with our academics. During freshman year, students gain instruction in four areas of the performing arts: dance, theater, technical theater and vocal arts. During students' freshman year, they declare a pre-major in which they study daily during freshmen and sophomore year. At the end of sophomore year, students declare and audition for a performing arts major which remains their focus as upperclassmen. During that time students have daily double periods of conservatory study in their major as well as an internship or apprenticeship with a professional artists/arts organization.",,Kahlil Russell-Starks,Director of Development and Partnerships,krussellstarks@schools.nyc.gov

In partnership with the Center for Arts Education, the grant allows for the planning and implementation of extensive music-integrated curricula for all students in grades PreK-5. Our goal is to encourage our students to use their imaginations to solve problems by nourishing their creative skills. We believe the arts provide entry points into Common Core Learning Standards-aligned curriculum for students and are a vehicle for students to build self-confidence by feeling successful in the classroom and can be a catalyst for increased student motivation and achievement. We are committed to hiring certified arts teachers to lead our arts programming, with a focus on visual arts. We strive to meet the NYS instructional time requirements. In order to allow learning within all four arts disciplines, we partner with cultural organizations, including the Center for Arts Education, Shen Wei Dance Arts, and Studio in a School. Through these partnerships, students not only reap the benefits of an enriched curriculum, but teachers also have the opportunity to grow professionally through planning and delivering instruction in cooperation with teaching artists, thereby expanding their capacity to integrate the arts throughout the school day for our students.

We produce a fully staged and costumed musical theater production with 3rd-5th graders each year.  Beginning in the fall of 2017, we will house a state-of-the art auditorium with new lights, curtains, sound, and A/V thanks to the DOE Arts & Special Projects Arts Space Grant we received this 2016-17 school year.  After school activities include modern band in which we explore a wide range of musical genres, including Latin jazz, punk rock, salsa, and popular music.  

We maintain instrument grant-based programming and equipment through Music and the Brain and Little Kids Rock.  In-house performances include monthly interactive jazz combos with The Jazz Foundation of America, and yearly interactive classical performances with the American Classical Orchestra.

Students understand how art has a variety of functions within historical and cultural contexts. Resources at the school, like iPads with museum Apps, help students become familiar with all kinds of art forms and hone their ability to observe and discuss their own artworks and the works of art of others. The program is enhanced with museum visits and a year-round calendar of exhibitions showcasing students' work. In theater, pre-k and kindergarten students activate and use their imagination through creative drama activities with storytelling components. First graders explore ensemble acting and memorization techniques through participatory stories that include folktales from different cultures. Second graders develop the actor’s instruments: voice, body and mind, while participating in play productions. Third and fourth graders engage in complex acting settings such as full-length rehearsals or scene work to explore theater making processes through various roles: the actor, the director, the designer, the spectator and the critic. Dual language students in fourth grade are trained in Jacques Lecoq’s Pantomime for Actors Technique which prepare them for the experimental theater course in fifth grade. Other fifth grade classes focus on acting or playwriting, and a specific theme or historic period such as Elizabethan Theater, Ancient Greek Theater and Musical Theater.","PS 48M's Arts Education Mission Statement

Arts education at PS 48M plays a fundamental role in the individual and social-emotional developmental stages of children. We believe the arts develop self-expression; expand a child’s imagination, creativity, critical thinking, awareness and sensibility for other subjects, disciplines, traditions and cultures; foster global capacities; and improve academic achievement. Our arts education sequential learning focuses on a four-stage cycle: experiencing and understanding art-making processes, developing art-making skills as well as key character values, creating art works, and reflecting and responding to artists, their own work, and  the work of others. Through our program, led and taught by qualified arts teachers and supported by long-lasting partnerships with arts and cultural organizations, we strive to enrich the school environment by embedding arts and culture into the core curriculum.",Kalitchi Figueroa,Arts Education Liaison/Theater Teacher,kfigueroa@schools.nyc.gov

We encourage students and parents to view themselves as life-long-learners who are inspired by the arts and act as creative participants in our school community.  We have a curriculum aligned to our national common core standards which includes giving students opportunities to develop as artists and develop curiosity, critical and creative thinking skills as well as communicate effectively. We provide our students with experiences that strengthen their creative voices and that allow them to take risks and work both individually and in collaborative groups. In our program our students can embrace global awareness, personal responsibility, and artistic integrity. We use arts education to develop their imagination and to prepare our students to participate in meaningful ways in their own future communities, jobs and families. In an effort to enhance our learning environment and to provide our students with more opportunities, we have partnered up with The Washington Heights Music Conservatory. For next year, we are looking forward to continue expanding our music program and to include other arts disciplines as well.",,Annie De La Cruz,Visual Arts Teacher,ADeLaCr3@schools.nyc.gov

As we look towards the upcoming school year, we look to focus on the following goals: 

Instrumental Music: Continue increasing ability to play instruments by teaching the students music theory, appreciation, and presentation.  Students in grades 5-6 will show their growth by performing for an audience of their peers and parents/guardians, while students in grades 7-8 may chose to perform in the annual talent show. 

Vocal Music: Continue to create unique and original content that aligns to curriculum and addresses the social and emotional needs of students in grades K-4.  Students in the Elementary School will have the opportunity to perform  Students in grades 5-8 may continue to build their vocal abilities by participating in the Intermediate School Choir.    

Visual Art: Continue to introduce Art to students in grades K-8 by allowing them to express themselves through painting, sculpting and collage building.  Through a series of cycles, students in grades K-4 continue to build on their knowledge and skill set by working with outside providers.

One, we want students to find their passion while here at Hamilton Grange, and through it build the discipline and work ethic necessary to be successful in whatever endeavor they choose. Two, we know that training in the arts is beneficial to the whole child. For instance: sustained learning in music and theater correlates strongly with higher achievement in both math and reading, art studies and activities help keep high-risk dropout students to stay in school, new brain research shows that not only does music improve skills in math and reading, but it promotes creativity, social development, personality adjustment, and self-worth; and students who study art are 4 times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement and 3 times more likely to be awarded for school attendance.

We believe the Arts to be at the Core of our Curriculum, enhancing the potential of contiguous exploration of various mediums of self expression. As a school community our staff bans together in support of the arts. Due to budget constraints, several teachers volunteer of their time to man various art programs before and after school. We look forward in securing any grant monies available to expand our current art program to include visual art and musical programs for all students. We believe that the Arts help students to make basic connections between curriculum and practical text-to-self applications.We partnered with the Morgan Museum and Library’s Morgan Book Project. This project involves our upper grade students in the production of their own personal narratives in the literary genre of the illuminated manuscripts. The partnership involved guided tours to the Morgan where students learn how primary colors for the manuscripts were obtained, maintained such as in ink gardens and how we can duplicate similar methods today to obtain our own colors for illustrating.","In continuance of our embrace and provision of arts related programs and services to our student body we have formed a partnership with Manhattan’s Victory Theater, Galley Theater, The Morgan Museum and Evoke Arts LLC serving all grades.

She worked closely with a third grade class throughout the year.  The class engaged with art works through an intense questioning technique that explored Observations, Evidence, Inference and Interpretation.  Our arts program works together to provide two performances a year which incorporate set design, dance and/or theater. One of these performances is always a musical theatre production. We always have overwhelming attendance by the parents in our community. This year's musical was an elaborate production of The Wizard of OZ.

Most of the classroom teachers include visual art in their regular curriculum. We offer pull-out instructions for strings and Little Kids Rock (5th Grade rock band), and after school programs for chorus, tap dancing,ballet and visual arts in addition to other programs such as Oratory (Circle of Gold), Fitness Club, Basketball team, and Soccer.","In spite of budget cutbacks and other obstacles we at PS 157X believe that exposure to the arts is extremely important for all students and at all cost we continue to keep and provide our students with music, art and dance even though sometimes it is quite difficult due to the fact that we are not funded by any CBO and/or Arts Program.

This year our school was awarded a grant to renovate our auditorium stage.  With new lighting and sound systems, students with cognitive, auditory, visual, and locomotor deficits will have new pathways to gain agency over their decision-making and have greater access to performances that would previously have been unavailable to them. 

In line with the school-wide instructional focus on reading this year, students in the music room have focused on music-making, particularly around literacy.  Using the Blueprint for the Arts and the Danielson Framework, this was implemented through student-led discussion, group ensemble playing, and language acquisition within reading music notation.  Experiential objectives have also been prioritized through arts field trips and in-house performances.

Our Overall Objective:
Our visual arts program is a critical and dynamic part of CVES and it encompasses an important role in our school culture. We strongly believe in exposing our children to the artists as well as to the artwork. We want our scholars to know what inspired the artist to create because we hope that it inspires our scholars to create as well.",,Alexa Sorden,Principal,sorden.alexa@mycves.org

Our classroom teachers and residence artists complement arts education by including the arts in special projects and performances throughout the year. Our teachers' lessons are based on the standards set forth by the Blueprint for the Arts and the Common Core Standards. Funding is key in order to maintain and expand these programs. To this effect PS 75, the School for Research and Discovery will continue its fund raising efforts to support our students' exposure to field trips and the arts outside of our school.",,Yokasta Pena,Assistant Principal,ypena5@schools.nyc.gov

Students are offered opportunities in all of the arts during our regular school day, weekday after school program, Next Jump, and our Literacy Through the Arts Saturday Program. One full-time visual art teacher, Resident Artist in Dance, Music, and Visual Arts, Project Boost, field trips to art institutions provided opportunities to all students at PS 119. Smartboards enable teachers to integrate the arts and technology. Students take virtual tours of world-renowned museums, attend performances, and study great works of art in the classroom and through outside field trips. We celebrate our diverse cultures through the performing and visual arts with annual festivities such as Fall, Winter and Spring concerts, special Mother's Day musical celebration, and Father/Daughter Dance. Social studies instruction includes an appreciation of the arts in each of the civilizations and cultures studied. Our Science Fair showcases student work demonstrating a rigorous integration of science, technology, social studies and visual arts. This years science fair theme was New York City based. Relationships with Dancing Classrooms, Smartworks, Music for Many, and New-York Historical Society have evolved over the years to permeate teaching practices. In the coming year we will expand the Arts Program to include Theatre Arts,and Choral Music during the day and/or after school programs.","The music teacher did not return to P.S.119 this year to pursue his professional performance career. At the same time, the actual student enrollment was lower than projected and the budget did not support hiring a music teacher at that point.

The theater arts teacher returned the classroom to teaching 3rd grade. She was able to offer theater arts in our after-school program.

Museum Night was not implemented this year as the school's annual exhibition. Visual arts instruction was also aligned to student math & ELA standards to support students during the state test. During parent engagement the art teacher offered workshops for parents and students. The arts program received the $1,000 from the city funding. For next year 2017/2018 arts program if federal and city funding is provided then we might consider using Mindup.org a behavior intervention plan can be used to support student emotional and behavioral growth through self reflection & meditation. We can have student performances by theme or month with a live band and residency to accompany the student's performance. We will continue to hold parent workshops during parent engagement.

In the Visual Arts, these include art making, the historical/cultural context of the arts, literacy in the arts and career and lifelong learning in the arts. There is an emphasis on art making and the exploration of materials in each class. During class students work towards mastery of media and a strong conceptual base for the value of arts in education and as a vehicle for student voice in a community. In Dance, these courses include dance making, developing dance literacy, making connections, working with community and cultural resources, and exploring careers and lifelong learning. Several times per year students are provided the opportunity to visit cultural organizations around the city and, when possible, outside artists/professionals are brought in to classes to teach and discuss about careers in the arts.

Teachers & Writers
During a T&W writing program, students come to think of themselves as writers. Most T&W workshops begin with students reading and discussing the work of contemporary and classic writers. Through these activities, students learn literary elements and techniques that they are then asked to use in their own creative writing—guided by a writing prompt assigned by the T&W writer. At the end of most T&W programs, students work with the writer to revise their work, which T&W publishes in an anthology and culminates at a celebrating event.

Studio in a School
The Studio in a School Residency Program is another program that is partners with us again this year. This community-based organizations offers customized art instruction for our students and caters for their particular needs. Residencies help our second through fourth grade students to build their foundational art skills and develop 21st century skills of communication and problem solving.

Classes are designed to develop drawing, observation and analytical skills using varied media and the application of the Elements of Art. Units begin with classwork based on practice activities and progress to applications of techniques in hands-on projects. Works by renowned artists are introduced and end projects include the creation of original artwork. The goal of the art program is to teach skills that enable students to make connections across content areas and engage in self-expression. Students who demonstrate strong artistic potential and interest, are encouraged to pursue portfolio preparation for specialized high schools auditions.

In addition, we strive to give students the knowledge and skills they need to use art as a way to interpret and portray the world around them. We launched a music program this year. We provide sequential music instruction with students working towards music literacy. We have established a pattern of 2 concerts per term for students with additional opportunity for performances at special events and assemblies. This year we began beginning guitar instruction with a goal of working towards offering modern band instruction.","We are on a cluster schedule. In this schedule, each student receives daily instruction in Art and in Music for approximately six weeks, one time per year (sometimes the duration of the cycle varies.) We also cycle with Math enrichment, Technology, Physical Education, and Science Enrichment. Six-week sessions present some advantages as well as some challenges. The learning curve is quite high for students receiving instruction on consecutive days; this schedule is conducive to project-based learning. Challenges include being able to track student progress over the duration of an entire school year.",Jeremy Barbaro,Music Teacher,jbarbaro@schools.nyc.gov

The revitalized ‘state of the Art’ auditorium has been put to good use re-establishing school concerts. for example we partnered with Jazz at Lincoln Center and had three concerts for our students through there jazz for young people program. We also took a group of students to two live performances at Jazz at Lincoln Center in Manhattan.

We hope to continue getting the services of outside professional artists who will conduct hands-on class workshops and on stage performances for the students. Finances have become a huge barrier to our goals. We hope that our goals become reality with funding for the Arts. We envision having celebrations in which the community is invited, showing the visual and performing arts, such as stage performances and arts fairs. The students can display their creativity through video, computer, musical and artistic displays. We would like to encourage and bring out the talent within our students and love for the Arts. This year we were successful in having more parent engagement activities which brought our families together to celebrate the Arts. Next year we hope to extend this more and bring more members of our community into our school.",Our school is an inner city Title 1 school where almost all of our learners receive free lunches.

All of our students' arts learning is comprised of both skills-based instruction and a connection to the discipline's cultural background and vocabulary. Instruction across all disciplines is aligned with or surpasses benchmarks outlined in the NYC Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts. Students have additional access to arts programs provided by our school's arts specialists in a variety of arts-based after-school programs (not discussed in this survey) It is our goal that our students continue to find success and grow both as performers and artists and pursue the arts well after they leave our school as artists, advocates, or appreciators. We hope to provide these opportunities through the continuation of our current programs in the upcoming school year.",We are a K-2 Early Childhood School in the South Bronx.

To realize the plan’s goals, each teacher was  asked to incorporate the arts into their day-to-day culture. This shift spans five years and is divided into two achievable phases, although access to the arts will be evident immediately. Equitable arts opportunities for students will be realized increasingly, as the culture of the Shakespeare School is strengthened and supported school wide.  
This strategic plan is based on a continuum for implementation , with an emphasis in three focus areas that are essential to its success. Its projected outcomes hope to spark policy, future action plans and budget recommendations for implementing a sequential and standards - based curriculum in the arts outlined at every grade level (not only 2nd and 5th as identified in the Blueprint for the Arts).   
This process has fostered further community awareness and hopes to provide the structure and catalyst for sustainable relationships between the Shakespeare School and key arts stakeholders. This concept is founded in the idea that every member of the community has an important piece of the larger puzzle, offering valuable resources that will contribute to the greater good - the future art education, awareness and experience of the scholars at the Shakespeare School!","We continue to produce Disney Musical in Schools production, absorbing full costs of the program. We chose to invest in sustaining the Musicals in our school because of the profound impact it has with all of our students, especially our English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. This year we selected The Little Mermaid Jr. A musical that is normally conducted at the middle school level. Our directors took on the challenge to provide our students with more enrichment time and activity with the arts. We continue to employ Dimitri Saari of The Society of the Educational Arts liaison to help design and build our set from recyclable materials.  Our students are dedicated, talented and professional, and this is a direct reflection of the commitment our teachers have toward exposing our students to multiple facets of arts instruction through theater.",Camelle Person,Assistant Principal,Cperson2@schools.nyc.gov

We host several artist residencies throughout the year that provide experiences in the visual and performing arts.

One of the major ways in which our school has grown in regards to the arts has been through continued expansion of our offerings to students. Our music department offers a full orchestra program where students have a choice of violin, viola, cello, or string bass. Some of the music department's goals for next year include having our music students perform both solo and in ensembles at the New York State School Music Association competition. This year we were fortunate enough to add a visual arts component and it is very exciting as many students have learned sublimation and heat transfer with vinyl. This skill has led to many HS for Violin & Dance creations such as shirts, pants, sweaters, mugs, plaques and other items as well. We also plan on building more relationships with cultural organizations and continue the ones we connected with this year (Alvin Ailey, Carnegie Hall & Dance Theater of Harlem).

Recognition of the elements of art gives students freedom to acquire self-esteem and self-mastery, and the momentum to pursue creativity. Through direct involvement in an integrated arts curriculum students make connections between art and their own lives, i.e., math and art, science and art, history and art. Self-direction within art classes allows students to express themselves while building problem-solving skills as well as as developing techniques used in making art: descriptive language (describing), analysis of purpose (analyzing), interpretive feelings (interpreting), evaluation of the art project (evaluating). Collaboration with the New York City cultural organizations in music, dance, theater, and visual arts provides a superlative opportunity for students to build a global arts foundation. For example, P.S. 86 has worked with the Guggenheim ""Learning Through Art"" for over twenty years with admiration and awe from students, teachers, and parents. (LTA is a 20 week program, October-May, with students'work exhibited in the Museum in May.) The 86 vendors'lists reflects the ""quality vendors"" who make connections between the arts, daily lives, and life styles of students, teachers and parents. Parents, families, and friends are enthusiastic supporters of 86' student concerts and performances.","This year P.S. 86 art teachers, on one of the extended days, explored techniques used in assessing art in the classroom to further develop students' skill levels, their interpretive sensibilities, their use of materials as well as assessing individual and group progress.                                           
PS 86 has also implemented a new program for Special Education students called ""Fly High"". The program is based on acquiring self-esteem and mastery not only in the classroom, but in alternative spaces, such as gallery studio workshops and museums. Th arts residencies are coordinated with the 86 school curriculum. Professionals in the Special Needs spectrum have been invited to observe and conduct art classes for the students. Staff Development for the Special Education staff is included in the program.        (All arts lesson plans are developed in accordance with the Common Core Standards: ELA and History, the National Standards and the New York State Standards.)",Margaret Bartelme,Arts Liaison,mbartelme@gmail.com

The school has two culminating assemblies, once in the winter and the other in the late spring where students perform in each of their respective disciplines. Also, twice a year we have an ""ART Gallery"" display on our first floor where students showcase their visual arts pieces. The displays are received well by parents, teachers and students.

Yet, as sixth graders, they experience two half-year arts classes so that they can make a more informed choice about the longer commitment. We are blessed with truly gifted arts teachers who provide rich classroom instruction; these teachers also provide authentic performance experiences at our Winterfest Arts Festival and our Springfest Arts Festival.

To offer this range of artistic options, we actively seek to bring in cultural organizations to supplement and expand our own in-school offerings. One of our greatest partnerships is with the Park Avenue Armory which, through its residency programs, student and teacher workshops, and programming, have afforded our students an extraordinary level of enrichment. All our work around the arts culminates in large-scale school performances held three times a year. These performances bring together all our artistic disciplines in a celebration of the arts. A poignant performance held each February is in honor of Black History Month where our school community is able to see the fullest integration of the arts and core subjects such as ELA and social studies.

We have a 6th, 8th, and a 10th grader appearing in lead or supporting roles films at Cannes and Sundance. As you know, two of the most esteemed film festivals in the world. 
 
Our 10th grader Taliah Webster is travelling to France next month to walk the red carpet with her own stylist and dress maker. She just read for a film to be produced by Queen Latifah.

Ms. Powers vision is to prepare our scholars in all facets of dance, building movement and vocabulary skills as well as creating, performing and responding to dance.

This was made possible with the assist of the Arnhold New Dance Teacher Program.

As our students create artistically through the arts they become more imaginative and strengthen their problem-solving skills.",,Christina Pappas-Russo,Art Teacher,cpappas2@schools.nyc.gov

Our arts program continues to be enriched by a CASA Grant thanks to Councilman Cabrera. This grant gave ALL of our students an opportunity to work with teaching artists from The Town Hall. K-3rd graders participated in dance residencies. K students learned jazz, 1st graders learned tap and 2nd and 3rd graders expanded their tap dance expertise. 4th and 5th graders worked with a theater teaching artist and created their own scripts. All residencies culminated with performances for families. For the 4th year, we had a Musical Theater Review. The enseblem consisted of 4th and 5th graders who auditioned for this residency. They worked with both a theater and music teaching artist. The residency culminated with 3 performances(2 for their peers and 1 for their families). For the 8th year, we held a Fall and Spring Saturday Family Arts Institutes. K-2nd grade families participated in a theater/visual arts institute and 3rd-5th grade families participated in a visual arts(cartooning) institute. Our Family Art Institutes continues to be a tremendous success with many families repeating the experience. Last year, we were awarded a 3 year SPARK Educational Grant from The New Victory Theater. Our 3rd graders attended 3 performances at The New Victory Theater, worked with 2 of their teaching artists, and 3rd grade teachers participated in 3 sessions of arts professional development.",307 is not a DOE building which sometimes tends to hinder us in programing.  Our gym is the only room available for dance and theater arts.  We now have a certified gym teacher and it is extremely difficult scheduling both the gym program and dance residencies which require gym space.,Marcy Schickler,Arts Liaison,mschick@schools.nyc.gov

In addition, students were offered an opportunity to participate in school- wide plays, dance performances, and talent shows as part of our after school program. In the middle school, there is a full time art teacher. The middle school art teacher also runs an after school art club where students draw. In the high school two art courses were offered to students in 10th through 12th grade, as well as an AP art class. 

Two field trips in partnership with the Jewish Museum were organized for high school students to watch films. Three field trips were conducted to the MET museum for all middle and high school students.

Our goal is to provide our diverse population with opportunities to explore the different art forms, the integration of the arts using an interdisciplinary approach across content area thus  following the common core curriculum. It is our plan to offer digital arts  and dance for the 2017-2018 school year.  

Our Arts program continues to allow students to develop creatively and challenge their knowledge of style, artists and cultural contributions to the world of the Arts. We support the individual talents that students posses in music performance, music theory and visual arts. We accomplish this through integration of curriculum across the content areas; we maintain high expectations through standards based education.

Students have also seen performances both in school and at Lincoln Center in the above mentioned genres. The entire school had the opportunity to attend performances at Lincoln Center. Our arts Committee has planned and implemented a family arts event for our community. The goal of our school is to ensure that the arts are a rountine for students, parents and our entire school community.
In addition to Lincoln Center Education, our school has a growing orchestra program.  Sixth graders receive orchestra instruction during the day and we have an elective afterschool Orchestra Club.

We also offer arts workshops and provide opportunities for parents to visit arts institutions city-wide with their children during school trips and other parent engagement activities.","The school budget does not allow for an in-house arts teacher.

Over the past ten years we have experienced great success through our partnership with Notes in Motion, each year the cooperating teachers and the dance instructors meet to determine the focus for the year, this allows the teaching artists to connect their lessons to an academic focus area. In addition, this year we have expanded the program to include a two part Parent and Child Workshop, where families can come in to watch a performance by the Amanda Selwyn Dancers and also to participate in a dance lesson where parents can learn about some of the things that their children have been experiencing. 

Our second partnership has been with Inside Broadway for a theater residency with identified fourth and fifth grade students. Here students are given the opportunity to create and perform in their very own musical. This residency helps to bolster our students’ confidence level as they perform for their audience.  Students and parents are excited about this wonderful opportunity and show their full support at our culminating performance. 

In addition, four of our students were awarded dance scholarships through Ballet Tech. This year, we hosted three seasonal performances and two performances for our dance and theater residencies.

The students participate in after school enrichment activities which include cheerleading, music, and arts-n-crafts.   Many students choose to join a club which meets during their recess time.    These students can be apart of chorus, recorder group, or a visual arts club.  The visual arts club creates inspirational posters for the school, dance festival posters for each class in the school, and decorations for school awards assemblies.   All students participate in the annual dance festival.  Each grade creates a choreographed dance which is performed for the school,   parents, and community.

After students have a solid foundation of the Elements and Principles of design, they will then utilize those lessons in different mediums within units such as Sculpture and Graffiti.  With each additional unit, follow up interim assessments will be given to the students in order to see how well the Element and Principle lessons are being enacted when drawing/sculpting further assignments.

In the end, the students will eventually move into a Life Drawing unit, which contains lessons that focus heavily on technical drawing, rather than creative drawing.  These life drawing lessons are somewhat complex, and will culminate in the students drawing themselves in a detailed picture that brings together all previous skills they have learned in prior lessons.",,Christopher Masino,Art Teacher,cmasino@schools.nyc.gov

Five of our students won awards this year for their Morgan books. Our student's art was exhibited in the Bronx Borough Art Fair at the Bronx Museum. Additionally, we are expanding our partnership with Open Door to bring dance, film and teaching artists into our classrooms.",,Elizabeth Fidoten,Arts Liaison,efidoten@schools.nyc.gov

Students then perform in talent shows, Latino celebration, Black History Month shows, and during our multicultural shows. When the budget and programming allows, students are offered a video-making course in grade 11 where the students make their own short videos.  Our students take trips to museums and watch films in an art class which supports our history classes. Our students in the Art Class created tee-shirts and canvas bags with artistic designs and quotes.

They met with each of our 8th grade classes for 45 minutes once a week for 20 weeks.  Awesome experience. I believe they will be returning next year.",,Antoinette M Saunders,Spoken Word Teacher,mstoni34@verizon.net

Students have completed two integrated theater projects and three visual arts projects. Students are offered an array of arts electives to choose from, including fashion, drama and theater, visual arts, capoeira, step, digital media, which include movie making and editing, digital graphic design and culinary arts. These electives are extra curricular, run for 20 week semesters, and students receive 120–180 minutes of the arts each week.

Teachers also provide specific feedback through a ""glow"", ""grow"" and ""how to"" which is collected in their art portfolios.

Students learn to critique their own work and the work of other students. Students who are interested in applying to art high schools participate in a rigorous after school program designed to improve their portfolios, teach them how to interview and present their work. In our general music program, students learn about key moments in music history, and a basic knowledge of music theory and notation. Students also have opportunities to compose music using technology. They learn how to play the guitar in the guitar lab. Our music teacher works with 8th graders during their lunch or advisory period to help them prepare for auditions to high schools for music. We collaborate with our school-based organization, Learning through an Expanded Arts Program (LEAP), for several after school arts programs. Our music teacher runs a modern band program, including guitar, bass, drums, keyboards and vocals. This guitar ensemble has performed at district events and most school events. Two of our paraprofessionals conduct the drama program through LEAP and have performed plays for the parents, staff, and students. Dance and visual arts is also offered through LEAP.",,A.

The course has multiple components and is designed to learn art concepts based on typography and other types of textual design forms. It is also a course to expand the learner’s knowledge of art by contributing ideas, creating art hands-on and the development of one’s own sense and understanding of its meaning.


Art & Design:

This will exemplify an art studio setting where the learner will be responsible for developing their art projects and the processes involved. Art ideas and concepts will be explored but with the learner designing their own ideas and determining the outcome.

 

Visual Art:

This will be based on learning how to develop art as an art-making community. Explorations of art- making will be independent but group based. In this course the learner will learn concepts of art that focuses on learning about what it means to develop art and create art as a network of artists.

 

 

Grading will be based on the following criteria:

● Class work /Class projects(Product/Project-Based, Independent, collaborative) 

● In-class projects done individually and/or with peers if project requires it.

● Written reflection or written assignment which aligns with project requirement.

● Portfolio Development 

● Discussion & Presentation

Each year it is our goal to align all of our subject areas in an effort to provide our students with seamless learning and inquiry. Our students are exposed to varied forms of art; including visual arts, theater, dance, and music.  Our in-house art teachers, along with our art consultants are innovative and seek to stay current with the trends and new discoveries within their disciplines. We take much thought and pride in how we align each grade with the arts. Each of our grades is assigned an art form according to their social studies curriculum. Our artists and classroom teachers collaboratively study the units and decide what the essential question and year's focus would be for the students across each grade.  We provide our students with authentic art instruction which allows them to truly understand the art form that is being studied. Our students are provided with many opportunities to engage in trips which enhance their art awareness and make their learning real and alive. Our students are also provided with many opportunities to study the varied forms of arts, collaborate with their peers and their teachers, and then present their Type III products. They engage in varied in-house art exhibitions, as well as exhibitions outside of the school on stage, in museums, and at dance competitions. We tap into our students' talents and teach them to be confident artists.","Our school is a diverse elementary school that represents the cultural and ethnic blending of New York City.  Our families represent cultures from all around the world and we take pride in helping our students discover who they are as artists, and share this wonderful discovery among each other. We believe in servicing the Whole Child, and we are the only nationally recognized Whole Child school through ASCD within NYC. We believe in tapping the talents of each student in an effort to create confident learners and artist in each of the disciplines. We are no longer a Title 1 school; therefore our parents are forced to raise all of the funding that is needed to support our strong Arts Program. Our parents are dedicated to the arts and share my belief that each child needs a balance between academics and the arts.  We are passionate about the arts and ensure that our students are aware of what it takes to be an artist.

As a working artist, I have a strong knowledge of the skills and techniques your child needs to learn to make anything from a drawing to a wire sculpture. In Studio Art your child will research many different kinds of art making, as well as look at all kinds of art, from prehistoric to contemporary.  My teaching is focused on the process of art making and on fostering creativity. My classroom is an enriching and safe environment for students to discover their artistic abilities. For students interested in pursuing a career in the arts, I will help them put together a portfolio for college or art high schools. 

The guitar program at PSC will change the way your student hears music and possibly the world. We foster a growth mindset by teaching students how and why to practice and that practice makes progress. Our guitar program is designed to give students the opportunity to be college ready musicians, as well as to be hobbyists. Students learn to read standard music notation, chord charts and tablature. They learn to use picks and to use the fingers of the right hand independently. Students play a variety of styles of music, however if they continue they often eventually focus on Classical, Jazz or a combination of the two as they are the styles most commonly studied at the university level. Students also have the opportunity to prepare for college level music theory, and ear training.","Because Park Slope Collegiate is a relatively small school we are only able to offer one visual arts program and Glee and Guitar classes. Students sometimes come to Park Slope Collegiate overage and under credited and accumulate credit at a slower than ideal rate. This increased need for remediation can limit opportunities for those students to take electives. Similarly, students who are entitled to extra services such as ELL or SETTS are often scheduled for those during periods which might otherwise be used for arts electives and thus have reduced opportunity to take those classes. We do not have the flexibility of budget and programming that is afforded by a population of thousands, instead we maintain a small community where, “the needs of all students are targeted at an intensely granular level.” (quality review 2009-2010)",Mathew Gross,Teacher,mgross52@schools.nyc.gov

Approximately 50 students across the school participate in off-site enrichment programming in the arts.","As a title I high school, we have very limited access to the necessary funding for arts programming.",Katy Swartz,School Business Manager,kswartz2@schools.nyc.gov

From K- 8 students experience an in depth investigation in the arts. Students create art through inquiry, with a strong focus on revision and reflection. Two times a year students exhibit and perform their work in our bi-annual Art Expo, it is an event drawing hundreds of people and a chance for students to present their work publicly. We believe giving students a rigorous arts education allows students to learn their own interests, develop their voice and expand their critical thinking skills. The arts are a vital part of children’s growth, not only as learners, but as whole people. 
What is a Culture of Creative Confidence? 
• A belief in ones abilities and ideas and the abilities and ideas of those around them. 
• A growth mindset (rather than fixed) that allows for development, evolution, improvement and advancement. 
• A personal outlook that includes an understanding of the importance of creative thinking and the process of making. 
• An ability to receive and give critique without complaint or insecurity.",,John OReilly,Principal,joreill@schools.nyc.gov

We also collaborated with the arts organization Dance Theater Etcetera in April, and held a three day school wide Poetry Slam with professional poets, who also facilitated poetry workshops with all of our students to celebrate poetry month.

It has been difficult to maintain any type of dance, theater, and/or music program long term because the we are only allocated a small number of regular classrooms and no storage space.  Storing instruments is challenging and clearing desks to create performance spaces is challenging and wastes precious instructional time.  Because of our space challenges, it is extremely difficult to recruit top talent who can apply to other schools with much better spaces.  As a result, we have only been able to maintain a fine arts program.  We do have a dedicated art room that is appropriately appointed.

This partnership was with the 92nd St. Y and supported our vision to provide students with STEAM education. Furthermore, we were able to partner with BRI C where students in second and third grade were involved in visual arts and students in fourth and fifth grade learned videography and made a short film.

El Puente’s IAP includes a codified professional development/training curriculum to support teachers to work with teaching artists to create integrated lesson plans and theme-based projects that will enrich the math curriculum. MS 50 has also partnered wtih El Puente to engage its resident mural group, Los Muralistas de El Puente, to create community murals on MS50’s large exterior wall on Roebling St. as well as on several interior school walls. Los Muralistas will not just to create the mural for the school, but will facilitate an interdisciplinary mural painting initiative. Students will gather oral histories in social studies, design mural proposals in ELA, study scaling in math, and analyze effects of erosion on different paints/surfaces in science.

Partnered with the World Monuments Fund and the Park Avenue Armory, the Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design (WHSAD for short) offers students a unique and engaging four-year course sequence with a focus in architectural drafting, design principles, and historic preservation. Our inter-disciplinary and hands-on approach to architecture, design, and the visual arts integrates internship experiences and skills training throughout core academic content areas.

Students receive instruction from highly qualified arts teachers in music, visual arts and drama. While there is no dance teacher employed full time the curriculum is enriched by collaborations with cultural institutions such as Dancing Classrooms and The New York City Ballet. The lower grade music program is built upon instruction of percussion, visual work and beginning notation. In the upper grades the music curriculum centers around students in grades three through five learning to read musical notation and playing a string instrument of their choice. In the visual arts - exploration of media, visualization and problem solving skills are developed over the six years that students receive instruction. The visual arts program relies heavily on visiting artists, contemporary designs, interdisciplinary learning and technology in the arts. Each year, all PS58 students showcase a piece of their artwork during the weeklong Annual Art Show. The Drama program uses scripted work and improvisation to teach students about the theatre. Classes put on small productions throughout the year. The fifth grade class culminates their program with a major performance.

In dance class, students learn creative movement, cultural, and traditional dance technique. They work with the elements of dance, improvising, choreographing, performing, and critiquing as their skills grow. Through their time in dance class, students learn historic and current dances from around the world and hone their ability to create their own choreographic work and be discerning audience members. Art class begins with a visual or tactile exploration for motivation or the introduction of an artist or skill technique. Students partake in a wide range of art-making processes and experiment with various media and techniques as they learn about art and artists from an historical and contemporary perspective. In music class, students experience a wide variety of musical genres, instruments, songs, and composers. They develop musical skills and concepts needed to succeed in any general music setting. Instruction draws on musical learning methods including the Orff Shulwork, Kodaly, and Dalcroze methods in order to allow students to explore their voices, strengthen ear training, and develop the confidence they need to succeed in any musical setting. Through their studies in all arts disciplines, students learn problem-solving, expression, vocabulary, social skills, self-confidence and creativity. Social studies and classroom vocabulary curriculum are integrated into arts lessons to further support student learning.",Our students are majority from low-income families and immigrant families.  We have many high-needs students.,Emily,Todras,etodras@schools.nyc.gov

The Nutcracker also has many of our special needs children performing in the show.This project has not only created a bonding with students in multiple grades and abilities, but with the teachers also. They pitch in to help with everything, especially performance night! 
The arts is very helpful as a vocabulary builder for our large ESL population. We have 26 languages represented in our school. The arts gives children the confidence needed to tackle academic subjects, and gives beauty to their lives through the visual arts, music and drama and dance.
Parents often ask ""what is the value of an arts education?"" We tell them that the arts is the only subject where the correct answer is not in the back of the book. You learn that the world is not just black and white and that your answer to an artistic solution is just as valid as everyone else.
They learn about their own culture and others' through art projects.","We have many ICT and special ed classes where the development of their fine motor skills is paramount.
They also benefit from making connections through the arts and connecting them to the social studies and math terms they use. Vocabulary words such as symmetry, radial, parallel etc are words that transfer between disciplines. It helps them to visualize these concepts.",Pearl Lau,Art educator,PLau2@schools.nyc.gov

Our Theatre Arts teacher facilitated several successful community-building events, including two musicals and improv shows. All 9th grade students took a required visual arts course in which they acquired academic vocabulary for analyzing historic works of art, their peers' and their own art. They used a range of media, including mixed-media drawing/painting/collage, digital photography, and stop-motion animation to create visually and conceptually compelling works of art that fulfill aesthetic, expressive, narrative, and/or political art purposes. Students had the opportunity to engage in supplementary arts experiences through our after-school program, which includes Dance, Music and Comic Arts Clubs. Students participated in Animation and Film programs through BRIC arts residencies funded by the CASA grant. Our John Jay Campus hosted its second annual Sing program, through which students from all schools collaborated to write, choreograph and produce an original musical. We hope to be able to offer more rigorous arts electives moving forward in a greater range of media, including graphic design, music production, and film editing.

Our goal for this year was to spark students’ thinking and creativity by providing a comprehensive and engaging program. Students learn a variety of techniques along with a firm foundation in the basic elements of art. They explore the important role the elements play in the creation of artwork throughout history. Students are inspired using a comprehensive range of visual works of art which reflect how the elements of line, shape, value, color, texture, etc. work together to make art.

Students engage in meaningful artmaking, analyze their own work and the work of their peers, as well as works by well known artists. Ample opportunities for exploration of materials are provided during lessons and also during periodic ""Art Center Choice"" studios. Arts instruction this past school year has put a focus on interdisciplinary projects, incorporating Science, Social Studies, Math, ELA, and Social-Emotional development into the visual art, music, and dance curricula. An additional focus of the Jesse Owens art program this past year was to increase parent involvement in the arts program through in-house parent arts workshops which were planned and facilitated by our Visual Art teacher with the help and support of our school's PTA.

With these reasons in mind, we collaborate with Community Based Organizations to help us finance our Arts program.  One of our biggest supporters in ""Change For Kids"".  This organization (CBO) has brought visual art residency, theater residency to our scholars, teachers and parents.  As a result of this collaboration, our students are more confident when making their thinking visible in and outside of the classroom. Through the work of another community based organization, ""Inspire Corp"", Yoga, African dance, song writing and visuals arts are also offered to students based on their choice.  We would love to have a residency that supports theatre.  However, teachers use literacy periods to incorporate the art of speaking and acting. We are a Title 1 school in good standing.  Many of our  students come from shelters, single family homes or foster care.  Nevertheless, we understand that access and exposure can make a difference in the lives of all students.  With this in mind, we are determined, that budgetary constraints will not hinder our students from receiving 21st century skills that support learning in other core subjects, ""The Arts"".",,Cheryl Ault-Barker,Principal,caultbarker@schools.nyc.gov

Right now we are working to develop a technological based art program for students who wants this strand, we are doing digital art, digital design and digital video to include students that are interested in technology. For the students who are interested in the Law program we are using a more traditional approach, teaching basic arts, arts fundamentals and studio art, as well including technical drama and dance.
At this time we are able to have several art classes that keep our students in touch with the demands of the new technologies in the creation of digital media, as well as using traditional classes for the students who are interested in painting and drawing as expression.","We obtained a grant that is helping us to develop the technology arts program in our school, with the resources that DOE provides is difficult to have a strong arts program as we need to be able to have more that 2 art semesters.
 Our students population, don't have the opportunity to explore in the arts as they are growing up and for some High School is the only place that allows them to explore creativity outside of the regular school day. We are developing more and more students that find a purpose in the Arts while they never really thought about it. Most of out students look for a more traditional education and are surprised when they start developing skills that will allow them to participate in the arts world as professionals some of this are: filming, video art, graphic design, web design. 
We are discovering that younger generations have a tendency to move toward the digital world more an more and schools are not providing support on this new technologies, keeping the majority  of art programs very basic or traditional.",vernon johnson,principal,vjohnson5@schools.nyc.gov

All students take a required arts foundation course in the 9th grade, then select one of three arts tracks to focus on (visual arts, acting, or art criticism).  Students then must pass five sequential art classes in their chosen area of focus.  When they are in their fifth (or more) art class, they are eligible to complete the graduation task, which we assess using an arts pbat rubric we have developed.  This system encourages rigorous and sustained training in the arts for all our students.

Through two grants received this past year (an ESD/SVP grant and an Expanding the Arts grant from the Tony Bennett Foundation), we have expanded our school's arts offerings to include after school classes in dance, music, visual arts, and fashion, and have created a new theater arts track in theater production.

Through an ongoing partnership with the Whitney Museum, all our staff received professional development in visual arts criticism from the museum educators at the Whitney Museum.","We are a limited non-screened community high school in a high-needs neighborhood (we are in District 16 in Bed Stuy Brooklyn and are a SWP Title I program).  Arts has been an essential ingredient of our school's mission and vision since we opened our doors in 2007.  We are also a member of the NY Performance Standards Consortium (the schools across NYS that have a regents waiver), which allows us to innovate performance based graduation tasks like our art requirement.  We firmly believe that our arts opportunities provide an essential engagement tool for our at-risk population.  We would highlight that our emphasis on the arts is woven into the fabric of our school and is vital to our identity and mission and success.  However, as a limited non-screened district community school, we do not receive any additional funding to support the arts, which means this extremely important aspect of our school community is something we have to fund entirely with regular school funds.  The grants we received last year do not contribute to the in-school arts instruction we provide all our students.  The principal teaches one art class each year to provide the necessary seats for our arts students, but that is not a sustainable long term plan.  As a school that can point to concrete benefits of having robust arts programming in a high-needs district, we hope to see increased funding for the arts as part of the City's commitment to equity in education.",Alex White,Principal,awhite10@schools.nyc.gov

All Visual Arts students were given a rigorous standards-based training in the arts. Students in these classes studied the elements and principles of art through text; video, careers and everyday experience in order to assist them in understanding how to look at art and the world around them in the eyes of an artist. Students participated in art critiques, which required them to pose questions and find answers. As they learned and practiced the various artistic skills and obtained new knowledge, this year prepared them for future art classes. In addition, English Language Arts, Math, Science, Social Studies and the Performing Arts was integrated into the curriculum. Students were given the opportunity to recognize and appreciate the connections that exist between Art, Dance, Music and Theatre. Art students displayed their work in their year-long Student Art Gallery, end of the year display and created props and stage settings for the drama production. Drama students produced a play, Midsummers Nights Dream. The Dance students put on the annual Dance Recital.

Students explore masterworks of art focusing on particular artists and art historical periods as a way to learn a medium and/or art making skill. All units include skills based exercises and terminate in a final project in which students can show their creativity and mastery of the material which is peer critiqued. At the end of the year, student create a portfolio of their work and reflect on the skills that they have mastered.

Students from 10th-12th grade are welcome to enroll in the AP Art History class which follows the College Board curriculum and can sit for the AP Art History exam in the spring in order to gain potential college credit. The year long course covers the length and breadth of the Western Tradition in art from prehistory to contemporary art and includes indigenous art from the globe, including; African, Central Asia, Southeast and East Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas.","Our high school is a science oriented school. Our distinguishing feature is the field studies program that all incoming 9th graders take in tandem with the Living Environment class. We are partnered with the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and within this partnership, students spend one afternoon every week in BBG or Prospect Park learning environmental science and biology, hands on, in the great outdoors. Most of our elective classes are geared towards environmental science and the sciences (sustainable agriculture, science research classes, AP Biology, etc.). As for our student body, our school is made up of mostly African-American students of Caribbean descent, with an additional small group of Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan African students. We service a large percentage of students with IEPS and use an inclusion model of instruction partnering Special Education teachers with the content teachers in the same classroom.",Jennifer Lemish,BASE Visual Art Teacher/ Arts Liaison,jlemish@schools.nyc.gov

We work collaboratively with parents, community organizations and faculty members to design rich and engaging learning opportunities in music, art, drama and dance.  Our teachers utilize the Blueprint for the Arts as a guide to create rigorous lessons that are intellectually challenging.

As a multi-cultural school with students from more than twenty counties, we construct projects that expose students to many cultures.   We believe that exposure to multi-culturalism will lead to respect and artistic appreciation of contributions other cultures have made to the global community.  Our school conducts cultural celebrations every semester.  Students create artistic presentations through visual art, music, dance and drama.

The George V. Brower administrative team and faculty members believe that engaging students in the arts promotes self-esteem and academic achievement.  Our interdisciplinary approach to teaching enables our students to analyze, synthesize and construct their own ideas and work products structured by content based learning.  Moreover, our instructional approach in the arts supports student learning with engagement through multiple learning styles.

Because of the continued support from Exploring the Arts (ETA), we were able to expand our arts program and bring in a vocal coach, a guitar coach, a percussionist and a graphic artist to work with the students. This year, we offered visual art classes to all of our students in grades 9-12. Students were exposed to a variety of art media and processes: creating 2D and 3D artworks to express ideas and feelings; developing a proficiency in terminology and techniques related to areas of art; developing the ability to understand and use the elements and principles of art and recognizing art as a means of communication. Students created numerous pieces of art, including self-portraits, which we put on display throughout the school. Our visual arts programs now include graphic design, print-making, and Photoshop. 
In music classes, students in all grades learned to play a variety of instruments and formed a school band. This band performs at our school concerts and other activities. We also have a chorus and a music production class for students who are interested in creating beats and writing music using technology.  We were finally able to get our Steel Pan Band up and running.  We were also able to offer theater classes to all 10th and 11th grade classes, and hired an organization called STEM for Dance to enable us to offer an even wider variety of classes to our students.",,Ann-Marie Henry-Stephens,Principal,ahenrystephens@schools.nyc.gov

This includes specialized coursework that connects music and the visual arts to the other academic learning strands (Math, ELA, Science, Social Studies, etc.) Students in Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 5 receive weekly instruction in the visual arts and music. Through differentiated instruction, the curriculum addresses the needs of our ENL's and SWD's.

The arts program delves deeply into the common core subjects while giving students in Grades Pre-K through Fifth the latitude to demonstrate learning over time in varied dimensions.

Ifetayo Cultural Arts Academy has given our students exposure to the cultural arts disciplines of West Africa and America. This year our students have received instruction in African dance and visual arts. Ifetayo Cultural Arts Academy has helped our students experience elements of the arts that they may not normally experience. 

Arts Connection provided our students in grades three through five with violin instruction.  Third grade students' musical aptitude is assessed.  Violin students are selected from the pool of students who demonstrate musical aptitude. The fourth and fifth grade students are returning students from the year before.

Our certified music teacher is a knowledgeable educator who regularly participates in professional development to enhance her craft. While new to teaching dance in school, our dance teacher is a seasoned educator.  She is currently exploring the steps needed to receive certification in dance instruction. Our dance teacher also attended professional development sessions regularly.

Throughout the Arts program, student artists make real world connections and create art that communicates something. In creating a real-world connection, you are embedding multimedia in a rich context in which students will learn and practice skills, gather and present information, and solve problems. Students connect to the real world through their project topics; the topics themselves involve some expression of students' lives and identities. Students can connect through authentic interactions with people and institutions within and outside school.  Students make meaning and find purpose by making real-world connections. Students connect through creation.

Unit 1: Drawing from Observation
Overview: This unit focuses on drawing from life.  Students learn to translate visual information to a two-dimensional format.  There will be an emphasis on planning in that students will learn how to create thumbnail sketches and compositional frames.   Additionally, students will explore value and space.  Finally, students will create an extended time observation based drawing that ties together the skills from this unit.
Students will create an image in color that combines at least two different styles of art, one of which should have historical significance.  The students will begin by researching a predetermined list of Artists provided to them in the form of a handout.  The final project can be mix artist styles in one or more of the following ways: New school combined with old school artists, an old master work of art combined with a modern affect,  a famous work of art combined with a current political/media event,  a master work of art combined with a cartoon, video game, etc.  This unit will explore color theory and serve as a culmination of all of the skills learned.
The additional classes offered through DTE, dance, spoken word poetry and drumming provide students enrichment and internship through artists in residency programs.",,Mary Capobianco,"AP, Arts Liaison",MCapobianco@schools.nyc.gov

In order to reach our academic goals, we integrate The Arts into all curriculum areas to provide an education that stimulates our students. For the 2016-17 SY, the arts teacher were given the opportunity to attend a yearlong series professional development with the DOE to incorporate formative assessment strategies giving students an opportunity to reflect and modify their work. Through The Arts program we provide, our students learn how to be creative, work cooperatively, stay focused and believe in their talents strengthening their self-esteem. Our goal is for our children to self-reflect on their choice of art forms. Our students explain and evaluate their work based on the standards and in alignment with the Common Core State Standards. Each child creates a visual arts portfolio that reflects a culmination of his/her best work. We will continue to equip our students with the creative and critical thinking skills that are vital for success in the innovative environment of the future.",,Constance Hahn,Principal,chahn3@schools.nyc.gov

Our Visual Arts program continues to provide our students in Grades Pre-Kindergarten through Grade Five, with rich Common Core and Blue Prints aligned instruction.
Another large part of our school's Art program can be contributed to the phenomenal cultural organizations, such as Inside Broadway, Shadow Box Theater and The Brooklyn Public Library, that we have been fortunate enough to partner with this school year.  In addition, we infuse Arts education through exciting field trips, in-school performances, and residency programs which directly connect to our curriculum and expose our students to new learning experiences.  One such program was The Green Golly Project, which taught our students in Grades Two and Three about classical music and imaginative storytelling.
Also, this year we were thrilled to be the recipient of two spectacular grants which we applied for. The CASA  Grant awarded our school with a fantastic Theater Residency program with Inside Broadway.  Through this program students from Grades Three through Five learned original songs, script and dance as part of their rendition of ""Cats.""  We were also awarded a Parent Engagement Arts grant through Shadow Box Theater, where parents and their children learned about Puppetry Arts and created their own puppets which were featured in a culminating showcase.  Both programs truly enriched our school community and inspired our students to develop their artistic talents.","Each year we strive to expand upon the amount of Arts education our students receive.  We reach out to cultural organizations, write grants and research arts opportunities that will enrich the lives of our students and enhance our school's Art program. 
We continually seek to acquire staff members who can support us in building and diversifying our school's Art program to include more Arts instruction within our school day. Some of the programs we hope to implement in the 2017-2018 school year include a Reader's Theater Program for our early elementary grades, a School Band for students in Grades Three to Five, and a Glee Club for students in Grade Two to Five.  
It is our hope that a greater emphasis will be placed on allocating funds to support such programming goals within our school and assist us in providing a broader variety of Arts based classes for our deserving students.",Dianna LoCoco,Assistant Principal,dlococo@schools.nyc.gov

In the Visual Arts, students are guided through a program that balances the development of technical skills and ingenuity. Art is offered to students in grades 8-12. Students use a variety of materials to create drawings, paintings, sculptures, and digital designs. 

The Music program encourages students to develop a love and appreciation of music. Music is offered in grades 6-12. Students learn to read music and play instruments. Students participate in the school band where they learn to perform in front of audiences. 

The Theater program encourages students to find their voices. Through instruction and direct experience, students acquire the tools of stagecraft, the confidence to create plays and skits, set designs, and develop acting skills.",,Rachel Jacobs,Visual Arts Teacher and Arts Liaison,rjacobs@afyw.org

Students use professional video equipment and learn how to broadcast live events.  After assessing students to see who had an interest in choral music or in playing an instrument, we created two additional classes in our schedule.  We now have a Chorus class and a Band class.  Our Theater program is in its third year. Our students will be performing a third musical at the end of May. This year, we had our very first Winter Festival.  Our Theater classes performed along with the newly established Band and Chorus. We also created a Set Design class in the spring of this year.  The students are creating, designing, building and painting the scenery for our spring musical. Our Arts department has established a partnership with BSAG, Brooklyn Streetcar Artists Group. Through this organization, Arts students have the opportunity to exhibit their art in a local gallery space. We will continue to use student portfolio assessments, sketchbooks, projects and our literacy initiative in the arts classes as a way of assessing knowledge and skills. We have attended professional development this year that addresses how to make our instruction more aligned.

We incorporate two periods per week of Studio Time into our schedule. During Studio Time students have an opportunity to participate in self-selected activities for a twelve week period. These activities include musical theater, ballroom dancing, ceramics, arts and crafts and a variety of other creative endeavors. We are home to a resident adult theater company. These actors work with our students and perform classical theater for them. Our students learn both the performance aspects and technical aspects of the arts, and they have assumed full responsibility for lighting, sound and stage management for our productions.

We have instituted a probationary program where a letter is sent home to parents when students need help based on their mid term report cards. We have increased the number of field trips to engage our art students in History, English and Science through the lens of art making. Changes made in the Academy of Art & Design Program are being carried over into the general art classes as well. Our contest participation went up by 40% and in each case, our students placed in the competition or were recognized.

Our PreK classes have music, movement, and visual art with both a classroom teacher and certified arts teachers. All K-2nd grade classes have general music and keyboarding with Music and the Brain. 3rd-5th grade classes have singing, percussion, and recorder with another certified music teacher. All students have dance with certified dance teachers, and 5th Grade has line dancing in physical education. All students receive visual arts from cultural organizations. K-2nd grades have theater with their classroom teachers. A few dozen students have Music Therapy. We have violin for 30 1st and 2nd graders, and 15 students participate in Bell Choir. 20 students in every grade participate in dance clubs. Sixty 4th and 5th graders use band instruments from the VH1 Grant. 50 4th and 5th graders share guitars from Little Kids Rock. Throughout the year, we receive several instrument and visual arts donations from the community. Studio in a School provides several parent workshops. Several years ago, the Arts Space grant provided risers, stage lights, and microphones. Next year, we hope to have a theatre residency for all students and a certified visual art teacher for K-2nd grades. Every child has several opportunities to perform in both dance and music concerts throughout year culminating in a Fine Arts Night with an art walk at the end of the year, as well as several Stepping Up Ceremonies. We continue to enrich the whole child.","We are a Title 1 school with 74.4% of our population receiving free lunch.

The Parents' Association has supplemented many of our activities so that we can continue to thrive on a limited budget.",,Natalie Rana,Arts Liaison,NRana@schools.nyc.gov

They provide residencies for our sixth, seventh and eighth grade classes. The sixth-grade classes did a project using Stop Motion Animation based on Science Fiction articles. The seventh- grade classes completed projects using Claymation to display three dimensional models of the Solar System. The eighth- grade classes created shadow puppets to represent the story of The Hidden Figures.  We will continue this partnership next year and enhance it with an editing component.

Technology: Our arts program was implemented to integrate technology (with the use of digital cameras, lighting equipment, and other accessories), to enhance output and to give students an experience in video production.
Sports and Arts: Students work with the Sports and Arts and Beacon programs to be further exposed to other aspects of the arts - music, African drumming, steps, graphic design, fashion design and modeling, and chess.
Trips: Students attend art-focused trips to the theatre, art exhibits, and concerts to expose them to a wide variety of artistic options and expression.  Thereby they will gain relevant information and find their niche in the art world!",,Dellie Edwards,Principal,DEdward6@Schools.NYC.Gov

Grand musical performances are held at the school in the fall and the spring. Our choir performs annually at the Corona Tree Lighting Ceremony, at Queens Museum art openings, and at our Leadership Events. In May 2017, our students even performed at Carnegie Hall!

Our visual arts program is growing as well, serving 660 students. Second graders show their work at Queens Museum, as do the CASA students in grades 3, 4, and 5. Additionally, all 1782 students show at least one piece of visual art at our May Leadership Event when our school is transformed into an art gallery. 

We started our theater program 2 years ago, and our students are begin celebrated at the Queens Borough Arts Fair for the second year in a row. The purpose for bringing in theater classes was to support all students, with a focus on Special Education and ELL students, in engaging in purposeful conversational English. The program has grown far beyond our expectations as our very talented theater teachers are bringing out the best in our very talented students. 

Dance is next. In the fall of 2017, we are bringing in a dance residency to begin to build out the fourth pillar of our arts program.

Our belief is that Arts education enhances the intellectual and emotional lives of children by stimulating their imagination, improving communication skills, including analysis and critical thinking and strengthening visual literacy. It promotes emotional IQ and builds character; encouraging multicultural awareness and acceptance. It instills self-discipline, inspires respect for craftsmanship and gives families an opportunity to share, explore, and celebrate ideas and feelings that children may not be able to put into words. In 2016, our teachers began implementing our Arts Elements Curriculum allowing 6th grade students to circulate through each of the available Arts disciplines including, Visual Arts, Music, Dance and Drama. Students received instruction in each course for one Semester. We placed 7th and 8th grade students in a class aligned to their area of interest as determined by the Student Arts Survey. Students will continue to be able to pursue their area of interest for 7th and 8th grade Arts instruction.

The program sends experienced teaching artists into New York City public schools, where they collaborate with classroom teachers to develop and facilitate art projects integrated with the school curriculum. During the 20 week in-school residencies, participating students examine, discuss, and create works of art. Students participate in three visits to the Guggenheim Museum throughout the course of the residency. These visits support the residencies, as students are immersed in an environment rich with the works of world famous artists where they will engage in art inquiry, offering new insights into art and challenging students to think critically about art and ideas. PS 88 also was awarded the Disney Grant. This allows us to partner with Disney artists in working towards putting on a Spring Production of ""Aladdin"". Students will perform the production in the school for students and family members. Additionally, council member Crowley awarded P.S. 88 with the “CASA” (Cultural After School Adventures) grant for our 4th grade students. Lastly, P.S. 88 hired a certified art teacher who is responsible for developing students' appreciation of the arts through various experiences.",,Candice Lowe,Assistant Principal,clowe2@schools.nyc.gov

The 11th grade team continued their work with a visiting teaching artist who helped to use a drama curriculum to introduce theatrical concepts, allow students to write and perform scenes and role play practical post high school circumstances, such as interviewing skills.

Our Engaging theatre program, equips our students to express themselves and learn life's core lessons.

Our school scope is to expose our students to the arts in order for them to find ways of expressing their feelings through integrating all the core subjects. Our school environment is such that all the arts are integrated, including a program after school entitled, Arts and Literacy. The arts engage students in a variety of modalities that enable them to achieve personal and corporate goals in music, visual art, dance, theater, and more. Our students have been exposed to many forms of art that aid in their achievement in core subjects such as literacy, math, social studies, science, and social skills. Thus far, our students have had the privilege of going on many class trips to museums, musical forums, theater and dance institutions which have expanded their experiences and personal vision. The art program at P.S. 877 has exposed students to many art forms, thus enabling them to grow in their personal, physical, mental, emotional and artistic development.

This will be measured by student performances, projects, journal entries, observations and lesson planning. Our students will explore, be actively engaged in, and will respond critically to the visual, expressive, creative and fine arts. Our classroom teachers design, plan, and implement curriculum using the arts as a vehicle of expression and support to content area work. Our teachers will include working with various media and techniques in the visual arts: Reader's Theater, storytelling and oral presentations, singing through the grades, and creative movement and rhythm for early childhood. Class trips to museums, concerts and theater presentations will be conducted to extend the partnerships with cultural organizations to provide our students the opportunities for scaffolded learning from dynamic teaching artists in music and singing. This year we are also working with the residency: Theatre Moves which works with all of our Kindergarten and 3rd grade students. In addition, we are the recipient of a CASA grant so that our 2nd and 3rd grade students participate in theater activities after-school. We also partner with Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, Create! and ESTA for instruction in music, dance and theater.   Early exposure and integration of the arts into our curriculum will expand our youngest learners' knowledge and enable our children to become more successful in the future",,Nancy Chow Sanchez,Art Teacher,NChowSanchez@schools.nyc.gov

Teachers immersed themselves in professional learning and practice around growth specifically in the area of assessment. Through the use of rubrics, checklists, the collection of observational data and analysis teachers and students reflected on what was learned and created next steps to enhance their teaching practices and performances. This year teachers have utilized technology such as video tapping to encourage and support their students to be reflective of their practice and identify areas of strength and next step through various evaluation tools. As well, teachers have been expanding the use of technology to include using the i-Pads for research and animation purposes. These skills are then put into action through live performances. Each child in grades 2-5 put on a production that intergrates theatre, music, dance and art. Twice a year there is an Arts Showcase where teachers collaborate for an evening of the Arts. In collaboration with the PTA every third grade student recieved their own individual recorder. After mastering the skills on how to identify notes, correct fingering and song patterns the third grade students then put on a recorder concert for their families. All fourth and fifth grade students also have the opportunities to try out for our PS 29 Chorus and Dance Company. These groups perform in different","capacities throughout the year. As well, the arts teachers invite our parents into the building for workshops around the Arts, to assist in creating scenary for productions and to participate in performances.  To further extend our In-School Arts program we have welcomed in outside organizations to work with our students. These organizations include; dancing classrooms, QTELL, Poppenhusen and Ballet Tech. As well, PS 29 works to make meaningful outside connections for our students and this year had the opportunity to take the fourth grade classes to see Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. Lastly, PS 29 has been granted a new dance studio, and an upcoming project to enhance and upgrade our Auditorium sound and lighting systems. Looking forward into the 2017-2018 school year we are motivated to continue strengthing our Arts practices within our building. We are striving to cultivate a learning environment where all students have the opportunity to express themselves in whatever aspect of the Arts resignates with them. We will continue to deepen our work around using various resources and technology to enhance our work and make meaningful connections with our students.",Francesca Pavlovic,Teacher,FPavlov@schools.nyc.gov

Our visual arts program benefits students in many ways. Beyond the tremendous value of learning artistic expression, they learn to visualize and complete creative projects. Through our arts education residencies, which include Indian Dance, Luann Adams Story Telling, and the Inside Broadway Theater Company, the students are making connections between visual art concepts and other curriculum areas. Our Indian dance residency taught the students the traditions and culture of South Asia. Through our story telling residency, our students were exposed to folktales and fables through a theatrical approach. Inside Broadway allowed the students to feel the background experience of preparing for a Broadway play. Each of these residencies also included performances that families attended to reinforce the love of the arts at home.

Grades K-4 students reaped the benefits of a City Center Artist in Residency dance program. Students learned about the basics of movement and space and were given the opportunity to work together to create their own dances using various parts of the curriculum as inspiration. All students in grades PreK-5 also received weekly visual arts instruction aligned to the Blueprint for the Arts. Projects are designed to build on student interests and skill level. All of our students are provided with opportunities to share their artistic pieces with the community on a regular basis. We believe that the academic performance and overall success of our students is enhanced by the presence of the arts. The dance, music, and art instruction is tied to content area learning, thus reinforcing academic knowledge. It also enhances both fine and gross motor skills and coordination.

Along with Music and Art, our students have Drama, in which they learn about acting, improvisation, and stagecraft. In order to supplement arts education, we partnered with Together in Dance. They engaged in long-term cultural movement residencies with grades 2 and 3 and musical theater residencies with grades 4 and 5. Through support from our local Council Member, we were also able to offer violin instruction to students in grade 4 after school with Midori & Friends, and several students participated in a ten-week dance program at Queens Performing Arts Center. For the first time, we programmed two semesters of enrichment electives for middle school students. Several enrichment themes are arts-based, including: storytelling, photography and media, developing an art portfolio in preparation for applying to high school, film study, and comedic improvisation.

All cadets receive both of the these classes, biannually, for their three years at Kappa Vi. We believe in sequential, experiential learning. Students, or cadets, are encouraged by their teachers to engage themselves throughout this curriculum to ensure for a well-rounded education and aid to core-curriculum classes. 

Drama at Kappa Vi focuses on specific areas. These areas are: creating original student compositions, creating parodies/satires, folklore play-ons, as well as analyzing how art imitates life. Students participate in a large production at the end of each semester where all of these art-forms are highlighted. For all three years, students are broken into groups, where they create and  perform on a daily basis.  

Instrumental music at Kappa Vi allows for students to actively participate in a concert band setting. In the 6th grade, students have the choice of picking their own instrument, learning the responsibilities that pertain, and the responsibility of mastering the basics. With these understandings, students participate in musical units revolving around both conflict, love, and motivation. One of the most important aspects of this sequence is how interdisciplinary instruction aids in both musical instruction/learning, as well as their core classes of ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies. Students of all grades perform at the end of semester concert to show the growth they have made in these areas.","Kappa Vi is a preparatory middle school which focuses on preparing students for high school, college, and the future. While being a Title-One school, Kappa Vi doesn’t spare any expense in providing worthwhile resources for its students. Instrumentally, Kappa Vi has acquired most of their instruments by donation. With this being said, administration and the teachers, make it the highest priority that every student has an instrument to actively participate. This year, students will be enhancing their dramatic performances with body microphones to amplify their great work. Much of the arts education at Kappa is experiential. As previously noted, Kappa infuses interdisciplinary content in all classrooms. In partnership with the workshop model, students/cadets experience consistency and rigor throughout their school day.",Richard Tarantola,Music Teacher,rtarantola@schools.nyc.gov

Each student participates in a production which is presented to family. This insures that all students have an opportunity to dance and perform for an audience. We have a full time visual arts teacher who implements lessons that integrate various content areas. We have a full time Music teacher who services every class in the school.  We have a grade 4 chorus, a grade 5 chorus and a school band who meet with her weekly. Students in grade 3 learn about and play bucket drumming and in grades 4-5 they learn how to play recorders. For a sixth year we have our CCAST (Cadwallader Colden After School Theater) program. This program allows us to perform a annual musical theater production. This year we performed The Jungle Book Kids. Approximately 80 students (performers, art/set design and stage crew) were provided with a 20 week after school program and are involved in this full scale production which was presented to family, friends and the community in the spring. This performance assists us in sustaining the CCAST program for the following year. This year 30 of our grade two students participated in a CASA grant sponsored by our Councilman's office.  The students met for 20 2.5 hour sessions with a resident from Flushing Town hall and learned Chinese Dance.  The program will culminate with a performance in June.  
We will continue to utilize all available resources for a continued comprehensive arts education program.",,Denise Fuccillo,Principal,dfuccil@schools.nyc.gov

We also host Ballroom Dancing for select grades! We are especially excited about continuing the K-8 music and instrumental programs, including adding creating a full time music position for middle school Band. We have begun to expand our instrumental and choral programs, including a new beginner Band/Orchestra with small group lesson instruction for grades 4-6, choral ensemble opportunities for the same grade levels, and Little Kids Rock modern band instruction for students from elementary to lower middle school. In grades 7 and 8, Band is a full time subject. Music at PS/MS 219 is inclusive and differentiated for our student population in opportunities, instruments and ensembles. The addition of an elementary school Visual Art teacher ensures that every student in grades Pre-K to 8 receives arts instruction weekly.  We are also proud of our Early Childhood Program where we seamlessly integrate literacy into visual arts, drama, music and movement. Throughout the school, we incorporate movement into everyday academic activities through Move to Improve and Activity Works. For the 2017-2018 school year, we would like to expand our ensemble curricula and bring more performance opportunities for our students in and outside of school.","Part of our school's philosophy of education is social justice and positive behavior supports.

Our strong and ongoing partnership with musical theater teaching artist Alastair King provides students and teachers with the opportunity to develop as musical theater artists and performers culminating in a gala musical theatre production on each grade each year.

The department sponsors a variety of extra-curricular activities and enables students to learn from practicing artists and to earn college credit through our partnership with Queens College.",,Amy Nass,Assistant Principal,anass@schools.nyc.gov

The students could choose from instrumental music, vocal music, graphic art & design, studio art, theatre, or the moving image. We continue to provide additional arts learning through our collaborations with World Dance Theatre (Cultural Dance Project), Arts Horizons, Jose Limon Dance Company, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and the New York Historical Society. Our Dance program was part of Arts Achieve over a six-year period. The Arts Achieve work created a foundation for our teachers and students to learn how to use peer and self-assessment to drive instruction. Our teacher team has shared these best practices, and this approach has been shared across the arts department. Two of our arts teachers were facilitators this year during ""Arts Monday"" professional development, and three of our other arts teachers participated in these professional development opportunities.

They learn a host of skills and acquire tremendous self-esteem when given varied opportunities to create. Because we consider art such an integral part of our program, our children are provided with open-ended opportunities to create. Our children use a wide array of art media including acrylic, finger, and water paints, pastels, crayons, and markers. In addition, children are given the opportunity to express themselves through drawings, sculptures, models, and paintings. 
We celebrate our children’s creativity by prominently and artfully displaying their work throughout our preschool sweet. Because we believe the artistic process to be even more valuable than the final product, we accompany each work with a transcription of the child’s thoughts about the piece along with pictures of the process.
The children participate with increasing interest and enjoyment in a variety of music activities including listening to music, singing songs, performing finger plays and experimenting with various musical instruments. We encourage the children by creating sounds using traditional instruments like bells, drums, and recorders. In addition, the children use some non-traditional instruments that we make out of tin cans, oatmeal boxes and cardboard containers.

The LCM program has dramatically increased self esteem and collaboration among students as they express themselves through positive musical messages.  

Additionally, our Urban Arts partnership offers rigorous residency programs in a wide range of art forms, taught by expert teaching artists.

This year two classroom teachers were Astor Fellows and their classes worked with the Metropolitan Museum on a year long partnership. Third and fourth grade students learn to play guitar or violin with the Music teacher who partners with Lincoln Center. During these classes, they are exposed to a wide variety of arts across a variety of genres and cultures. Our dancers practice creative movements, develop motor skills, focus on specific styles of dance and explore a variety of ways to create and manipulate their own movement. Our arts programs provide opportunities for students to become literate in art, make social, cultural and historical connections, become lifelong learners and advocates for the arts. Additionally, our third, fourth and fifth grades are given the opportunity to participate in an arts club (dance, visual arts, chorus). This year we were awarded a Midori grant in which 40 students were instructed in guitar.  We celebrate the arts throughout the year through shows, exhibits and classroom presentations attended by the whole school community.

Our Visual Arts Curriculum focuses on the various art forms and is aligned with the Blue Prints for the Arts. Our students study various composers. Our diverse population has afforded us the opportunity to study various cultural dances during our annual Dance Festival. 
Visual Arts residency has been made possible for past two years through funding from a private donor to secure a residency with Studio In A School. The program provides comprehensive, media and strands rich, sequential visual art instruction to all K-5 students. Each grade receives weekly art instruction in a range of media, designed specifically for PS 96Q, in alignment with the New York City Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Visual Arts and Common Core. Classes are instructed in collaboration with the classroom teachers and a professional studio visual artist. The program equips students with multiple opportunities to develop the ability to work from observation, memory, and the imagination, to plan, reflect, revise, and to collaborate, to develop ideas from multiple sources and synthesize their ideas to create original works of art that are personally relevant. 
Our goal is to continue to increase our students’ exposure to the Arts.",,Vivian Eweka,Principal,Veweka@schools.nyc.gov

In the back of my room I had several art centers that students were allowed to go to to explore and create when they were finished with their work and I also had art centers in the early grades.This worked out well, and was usually done when the main idea/objective was learned.
My school is a wonderful school and I feel fully supported by the administration!!!!
I love coming to work!","My school has a large percent of english language learners. We have both dance and art which works out nice since we both work well together. I use song/movement/poems/theatre in my art lessons and try to provide each class with a trip.

Grades third through fifth make thoughtful inquiries and capture details about life, recreating those details in art making and exploration working towards benchmark 5 in the New York City Blueprint for the Arts. With each art lesson students are exposed to the life and works of artists from the past and present around the world assisting students in making historical and cultural connections. The life and works of artists teach and inspire students about the many career possibilities available in the arts. Students explore and manipulate a variety of art mediums using the elements and principles of design through 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional art works. Through assessment and critique students read, write and reflect upon art making reinforcing literacy skills. When writing assessments in the arts students support findings with evidence. In addition, students work independently and in teams honing skills and increasing enjoyment and appreciation of the arts.",,Deirdre McShane,Assistant Principal,dmcshan@schools.nyc.gov

PS/MS 124 will continue to enter art competitions such as the Queens Borough Arts Festival, Ezra Keats Bookmaking Contest, and PS Art. In the graphic arts at PS/MS 124, students are encouraged to develop an interest in the field of graphic design. They develop their digital manipulation skills by creating a complex piece of artwork using Adobe Photoshop Elements in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs. The program enables students to create, edit, organize and share images with the use of a computer. In addition, the dance/creative movement at PS/MS 124 emphasizes building a foundation of the dynamics of movement with the incorporation of spatial awareness, use of effort, shapes, and relationships between the dancers.

In order to accomplish this, we realize that a well-rounded education in the arts is a critical component in preparing our students to enter the professional community. Students are exposed to career-building skills in the arts-related fields and gain an appreciation of art as a means of expression. By infusing the arts with technology, we provide students with an arts curriculum that is challenging as well as rigorous. Students are supported to apply knowledge and skills learned in the arts to make connections to the world around them. Our Arts curriculum supports goal setting, prioritizing, and strengthening interpersonal skills by working collaboratively with peers, and working independently. We put great emphasis on literacy in the arts and these skills support interdisciplinary units of study. This year, we were fortunate to have two of our students selected to participate in the Queens Boro Arts Fair, as well as another student as a semi-finalist for PS Art. We were also partnered with Theater for a New Audience Residency. Theater residents worked with our students to create plays. At the culmination of the residency, professional actors brought the students plays to life by acting out what they wrote and created.

We believe that providing visual arts and music education is integral to addressing the needs of the whole child. Our visual arts program serves all of our students and is integrated and sequential. In Pre-K through Grade 5, our visual arts instruction increases children's awareness of their physical environment, extends and develops the use of the senses and encourages inventive thinking. Our visual arts program supports individual interpretation of ideas and feelings while providing opportunities for experimentation in a variety of media, such as painting, drawing, printmaking, collage, sculpture, applied design and technology. Our art teacher nurtures our children's curiosity by encouraging our students to explore and express their individual interpretations of artwork. In Grades Pre-K – 4, our music teacher implements differentiated instruction and builds upon the strengths and challenges of multi-cultural, multi-lingual, and multi-racial groups of students. She teaches instrumental music to grades K-2 (including keyboarding in collaboration with the Music and the Brain program). This year, we received a grant from the Carnegie Hall Weill Music Institute Link Up Program to provide great musical experiences for our Grade 3 students utilizing recorders. Our music teacher has also established a specialized school chorus consisting of Grades 4-5 students.",,Michelle Belil and Larissa Cole,Art and Music Teacher,MBelil@schools.nyc.gov

There are 5 different career academies; Academy of Graphic Arts and Computer Science (AGACS); Academy of Visual and Performing Arts (AVPA); Academy of Health Professions (AHP), Academy of Law and Humanities (ALH) and Academy of Engineering and Architecture (AEA).  Each career academy focuses on career development courses that are unique to them.  Within the Academy of Visual and Performing Arts students learn Studio Art, Theatre, Instrumental Band and Vocal Music.

In our arts class the students are exposed to various eras in art. The students are encourage to learn the different styles of artists such as Vincent Van Gogh and Leonardo De Vinci. Students learn about the different art styles during a specific era, and what type of art skills that the artist of the given era focused on. The students then take the style and implement it into a painting. Students are also encouraged to write about their art and use academic vocabulary to enrich their writing pieces.
In the Music program the students are learning how to play the Recorder and the  Drums. The students have put on several perfo throughout the school year such as Black History Month, and Holiday shows which teaches about different cultures.
We continue to work with Marquise Studio. During the session with Marquis Studio, the students using Technology to create Architecture Figures such as home and building.

Through this modality, the children more readily develop an appreciation of abstract concepts and extend their understanding of those previously mastered. With this in mind, we have adjusted our curriculum to include singing, dancing, performing, and the visual arts. Our students have the opportunity to incorporate the arts into other subjects, making topics come alive. They become active learners, ready to engage in activities that supports higher order learning. They also cultivate an interest in unfamiliar concepts. They build background knowledge and develop intellectual curiosity. NYC is a treasure for art enthusiasts. Our students venture off school grounds to watch dance and choral presentations.",,Marci Reiter,Tech Staff Developer/Budget,mreiter@schools.nyc.gov

Field trips and assemblies are used to integrate all 4 forms of the arts into the learning experience of students. The Blueprint for Teaching and Learning the Arts is used to guide the implementation of the PS37Q art instructional program. An interdisciplinary approach to teaching the arts focuses on literacy with social studies connections, self expression and talent development.  Students are encouraged to use the arts to understand historical context and study cultural diversity. Students utilize artistic expression and their imagination to practice their skills as speakers, listeners, writers, designers, visual artists, actors, singers, dancers, researchers, critics and collaborators. Parents are invited to participate in art workshops and museum trips.

In the four arts disciplines, students use their imagination make decisions, problem solve, and work together in groups cooperatively .They have hands on learning and make social ,cultural and historical connections.

We have a full-time Visual Arts teacher with a classroom as a dedicated art space where students in Grades K-8 received regular instruction in the Visual Arts. Lessons are congruent with the Visual Arts Blueprint. Our Art teacher has been attending monthly Arts Mondays professional development via the Office of Arts and Special Projects, Queens South to learn the latest practices in formative assessment in the Arts. Student work has been entered into various contests and exhibition opportunities, through which our students have had the experience of seeing their work on display in a larger community setting.
Our school continues its partnership with Lincoln Center to provide students with engagement in the arts via residencies with teaching artists at our school in music, drama/theater, dance and visual arts. Students see professional performances at Lincoln Center as well as at our school where families are also invited to attend Family Events. 
This year's instruction is culminating in a joint effort between our art teacher and Lincoln Center to showcase student work at the school with an evening exhibit of student work along with dinner, workshops and a live concert provided by Lincoln Center. We expect both of these venues for artistic expression and engagement to continue next year.","The arts are essential for engaging students at school.

Students are learning about artists like Pietro Lorenzetti, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent Van Gogh, Francisco De Goya and Pablo Picasso. Students are exposed to different forms of arts such as dancing, music, and theater. They visit the American Museum of Natural History, Brooklyn Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern art (MOMA) and other institutions such as Brooklyn Academy of Music, Carnegie, Repertorio (Latino Theater) and Manhattan Theater Club. The school has created partnerships with these organizations and has had artists visit classrooms to discuss their art work. Students make connections with the socio-cultural and historical significance of theater. This year, Mathematics, Science Research and Technology High School's goals are to

 • Integrate arts into all content areas.
 • Create partnerships with various arts organizations to enrich the culture of our students.

 Mathematics, Science Research and Technology High School provides students the opportunity to earn more than one credit in visual arts. Students are able to express themselves through the arts and build skills and knowledge in a variety of forms.

This is achieved through a differentiated and multi-sensory approach to learning. Not only do our classroom teachers teach various art forms throughout the year in content areas, we are also fortunate enough to have community-based arts partnerships as well. Another goal at P.S. 2Q is to continue the current partnerships, to expand the programs offered to include more students, and to add more variety to the programs offered. We were very grateful to provide multiple programs to our students this year, including visual arts instruction, dance, music, and dramatic arts.

Grants from our arts partner City Lore Inc. brought residencies in songwriting, Indo-Caribbean dance, music and visual arts to our students while a CASA grant afforded them musical theater and theater trips. Little Kids Rock provided a music grant enabling student participation in programs before and after school in addition to instruction already offered to 150 students in guitar, violin and wind instruments in Grades 3, 4 and 5. Our award winning choral program continues to flourish, receiving top ratings at NYSSMA festivals. Our Artist in Residence programs continue to bring direct arts instruction to all our students while focusing on our magnet theme of Asia this year and Africa next year.  Multiple celebrations and performances featuring these residency and musical programs are held during the school year. We are a SEM school engaging in multiple enrichment opportunities through directed magnet or interest-based enrichment clusters in Grade 2, 4 & 5 while early childhood students receive arts instruction in our EaGLE program. We will continue our rich, successful cultural arts partnerships with City Lore, JALC, Pandora, Little Kids Rock, Dancing Classrooms, Inside Broadway and Joyce Theater. Our goal at PS 69Q is to provide comprehensive, rich arts experiences that educate the whole student.","At P.S. 69Q, we strive for an instructionally focused learning environment emphasizing our multicultural and diverse background of 1,048 students who have 24 different home languages and cultures. We are ""The School of Cultural and Performing Arts"" and endeavor to offer as many arts experiences to our students as possible. We believe that the arts play a vital role in the development of our students not just academically but in their social and emotional growth as well. All students are encouraged to be meaningfully and thoughtfully engaged in academic, artistic, collaborative and socially conscious tasks where every student is accepted and honored for their accomplishments, potential and individuality.  We annually rotate our magnet theme between Asia, Africa and the Americas, integrating these themes throughout our arts curriculum, residency programs, cultural events, multiple school music celebrations and performances while making connections to our students own varied unique cultural experiences. We embrace all opportunities to collaborate with a variety of arts partners that are brought into our school through federal and state grants, the public sector, NYC DOE approved arts partners and the families of our students.",Deborah Strack Cregan,Arts Liaison/SEM Specialist & Magnet Teacher,dcregan@schools.nyc.gov

The program is sequentially developed on disciplined based art education and is aligned with the New York City Blueprint For Teaching and Learning in Visual Arts and Common Core Standards. Art concepts are taught through activities based on the elements of design: line, shape, form, texture, space, color and value. Art instruction lends itself to integrating with other subject areas. The purposes of these activities are to help students develop awareness of, and appreciation for, the skills in communicating through art, and a feeling of pride and satisfaction in their work. Multicultural art activities are infused into the curriculum. Art in the elementary school gives students the opportunity to develop an interest in art appreciation and to develop critical and creative thinking skills. The music program at P.S.70Q, which also follows the standards, provides an opportunity for all students to receive a comprehensive performance-based music education. Through the study of a wide range of music literature students can become intelligent consumers, producers, and/or creators of music. The high level of motivation required for performance courses is an invaluable asset to educational growth. School performances contribute to developing a sense of responsibility in students.",,Sophia Mavromatis,Visual Arts Teacher/Art Liaison,smavromatis@schools.nyc.gov

The result was the Academy for Careers in Television and Film (TvF), which opened its doors to its first freshman class in September 2008. Now located on the waterfront at the new Hunter’s Point Campus in Queens, TvF serves over 540 NYC students in grades 9 through 12.

In order to ensure that all graduates are prepared for the workplace, TvF is committed to providing our students with the opportunity to work alongside industry professionals in authentic work experiences.

In general music, students continue using the mallet percussion and drums while learning basic music theory and solfege.In the ensembles: chorus, band and orchestra, students learn how to read music and learn to apply musical notation to a number of genres from the Baroque era to popular music throughout the years. It is the mission of the music department to teach students to be life-long learners. Much emphasis includes working towards preparing students for performing arts high schools to become career and ready in any subject area. In our Art classes, we enable students to use a variety of processes to stimulate creative products, manipulatives, and self-determined learning and making. Students explore all different means of mediums while putting together portfolios for specialized high schools. Art classes are actively engaged in using self and peer assessment to promote growth and revision within their projects.

Our school wide enrichment model allows students to spend time learning about and creating various art projects from jewelry making, dance, photography, and drama. This program culminates with a performance and exhibition to the school community. Our after school enrichment programs supported further instruction through the arts. Programs such as drama, visual arts, and dance were offered to all students. Our students' artwork was selected to be featured not only in the Borough Arts Festival but at the Snug Harbor Children's Museum as well. An Artist Walkway/Gallery is dedicated to showcasing student artwork throughout the school year. In addition to the walkway, our school building celebrates students' artwork on all bulletin boards, hallways, stairways, and the auditorium. At P.S. 1 our goal is to continue an arts-rich education, exposing students to more arts learning through dance, music, performance and visual arts.

Students are exposed to different dance forms, line dance, yoga, cultural dance, ballroom and role play in dance and movement. In visual arts, students learn about famous artists and how to use their techniques. In collaboration with several arts residency programs, students have the opportunity to gain valuable skills in music, dance, theater and art literacy while learning to work together as a team and gaining experience in performing live in front of an audience. Students use their voice and instruments during music and have the opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall.

We are creative in utilizing our television studio and by allowing students hands on experience when filming productions put on by students. Core subject teachers continue to work with our TV studio teachers to have student presentations filmed and streamed throughout the building on the hallway televisions so that we can better reach the student body with messages and spirited information.

As we are geographically remote from many cultural institutions, our school-based programming is of vital importance.  During the 2016-2017 school year, we ensured that all four arts disciplines were represented through cluster programming or artists-in-residence.  Grants, via the City Council CASA program and NYCDOE ELL/SWD funding, enabled us to accomplish the aforementioned. 
Assemblies and field trips continued to serve as vital components of our artistic character.  Literacy and Social Studies were often infused throughout our arts curricula, thus ensuring thematic, academically relevant ties to classroom instruction.   We are exceedingly proud of the strides that our arts department has made, and anticipate further expansion in years to come.","Please note that the data recorded in STARS does not reflect the entirety of our arts programming.  For example, third grade does not currently receive music instruction as a cluster period.  However, students participate in the Link Up program in conjunction with Carnegie Hall, whereby they enjoy intensive orchestral music education and learn to play the recorder.  They also participate in a community-oriented Flag Day ceremony which fuses theater, dance, and music - and is the centerpiece of our civic education as PS 6.  The aforementioned is done during the music teacher's administrative period, or when the classroom teachers have availability and is not termed as ""music"" within the tracking database.  Where programming does not suit our creative/compliance needs, we accommodate accordingly.   In that vein, the dance teacher has instituted a Dance Company.  Children engage in choreography/performance for festivals and events throughout the school year.

Bronx Net filmed the production along with several student photographers and videographers, expanding the film production program we began last year. Students were involved in every aspect of the production from sets, props, costume design, stage management, and lighting - in addition to those in front of the camera. We are currently in production on our second play West Side Story.

As part of our goal to maintain our arts education programs we will implement in September 2017 individualized programming for the incoming 6th grade.  Over the next three years individual student programming will expand to include all 6th, 7th and 8th grade students.

Students also begin participating in school plays that reinforce music, visual arts, and introduce choreographed group dance. Third grade students learn to read music while playing the recorder.  In the Fourth and Fifth grades, children choose an academy that they work with for the remainder of their time at school.

These programs focused on improving literacy skills for our students (mostly with Individual Education Plans) through theatre. All classroom teachers ensure visual arts are an embedded component in their literacy programs. Most classrooms participate in multiple performances involving dance, music and visual arts. We have a large student body involved in chorus. Also, this year we incorporated S.T.E.A.M. for Pre K - 5th grade for our Black History Month featuring the first three African American women who worked for N.A.S.A. from the movie ""Hidden Figures."" The program allowed the students to incorporate initiatives that created critical thinkers, increased science literacy, encouraged student exploration of visual arts, theater, music, dance, architecture, and puppetry. In the future, P.S.44R will continue to develop a passion for creative learning in each and every child allowing students to reach their fullest potential.

The curriculum is aligned to the CCLS as well as the Blueprint for the Arts. During this time students were made aware of the standards, were given opportunities to self-assess, peer-assess and create goals so that they can take ownership of their learning. Students also received visual arts, dance and theater instruction in the classroom.
This year we partnered with Marquis Studio and all students took part in a Visual Arts and Theater Residency. During the Visual Arts Residency students learned about different artists and different art forms. The students learned how to create a monoprint, how to combine primary colors to make secondary colors and how to construct a collage.  At the conclusion of the session, the students had an opportunity for reflection and were able to view their peer's work through an Art's Share. During the Theater Residency students learned how to use their voices and body expressively in order to perform in front of an audience, how to work with peers and how to imitate and create basic emotions. Students then had an opportunity to perform for an audience.
This year our Pre-K sites participated in the NYC Pre-K Create track and learned how to incorporate the visual arts, dance, theater, and music into their ongoing instruction to promote student learning in multiple PKFCC domains. Through PD we learned new ways to design classroom learning centers so that art activities are integrated.",,Lisa Sarnicola,Principal,lsarnic@schools.nyc.gov

We have purchased keyboards and percussions to enhance the musical capabilities of our students during the school day.

There is a strong family involvement component in which the parents participate in cultural activities and engage in a variety of musical and artistic experiences.

We have two licensed art teachers in both visual arts and music who have attended professional development to increase their knowledge in these areas in order to fully incorporate and embed the arts into our curriculum.  Our goal of becoming a school of the arts, is partially based on the fact that a strong art curriculum combined with content area subjects, enhances and improves student learning and in some cases has even helped in closing learning gaps; especially for English Language Learners  and Students with disabilities.  This year we have dedicated space in our building to accommodate an art room and a music room housed with equipment such as instruments, smartboards, computers, and an abundance of art supplies. We also use the Blueprints for the arts to guide our instruction and educate our art teachers who meet with other teachers across disciplines and grades to create interdisciplinary lessons.  Our art teachers also continually attend professional development opportunities to expand their knowledge and continue their learning.  A new initiative this year is the creation of a grant team who meet weekly to seek out grants and opportunities to provide funding for our arts program. We have obtained a grant to create a new-state of the art visual arts room and construction will begin this summer.",,Lisa Killelea,Assistant Principal,lkillelea@schools.nyc.gov

We have also expanded on our International Day celebrations to include more performance opportunities that highlight a variety of cultures. In addition, we have created partnerships with local Arts Educational programs to prepare our students with the foundational skills needed to succeed in these realms.

In addition to students having classes in art and music programmed into their daily schedules, arts activities are integrated with instruction in academic core subjects by making use of the Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, the NYS Learning Standards and the Common Core Standards. Many of our students are nonverbal and the arts are a means by which to enhance their learning opportunities and enrich their lives. Learning through the arts contributes to the academic, social and personal development of each student as well as supporting the progress of their IEP goals. By incorporating the arts in academics, P53K effectively accommodates individual learning differences within a flexible learning environment allowing students to perform according to their cognitive and physical abilities, consequently motivating our students to learn. We have continued our residency with Marquis Studios with a focus on Mask Making.Students crafted masks with a variety of materials such as paper, wire, plaster and foil to create wearable three-dimensional works.  They focused on expressions and exaggeration as well as color, and pattern. We were awarded the Disney Grant allowing our students to see a show Aladdin on Broadway, backstage and talk to the cast.

P77K has a strong visual arts program, in which students learn skills in drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, digital media and animation.  Students are also exposed to art in their community through participation in programs at MoMA, Brooklyn Art Museum, and Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. Each year, we highlight their work and invite families to share in their accomplishments in school and local art exhibitions and an annual student film festival. Our students have also had work selected for the international VSA exhibition at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., PS Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Times Square Coalition for the Arts, Brooklyn Borough Arts Festival, and have been awarded the city and district awards in the Ezra Jack Keats Bookmaking Competition. In the performing arts we have a lively music program in which our students study a wide variety of musical genres and explore playing different instruments. We have partnered with cultural organizations including BAM, Music for Many, and Marquis Studios to provide further exploration of music, as well as dance and theatre to give our students the opportunity to express themselves through movement, build peer interactions, and strengthen fine and gross motor skills.",,Marisa Beharry-Vanzie,AP,mbeharryvanzie@schools.nyc.gov

Arts education at The Children's school often integrates with learning in other disciplines including social studies, science and English language arts. In all units of instruction there is an emphasis on higher order thinking skills.

Through visits from our arts partners, students are introduced to and develop an understanding of how the arts reflect diverse cultures of the past and present - through music, movement and visual arts such as painting, sculpture, printmaking and collage.  Our collaboration with the arts' organizations has led to an important kind of thinking which transfers to all areas for our students. These multisensory means of engagement are aligned with CCLS and the NYC Blueprint for the Arts. The arts have positively contributed to the social emotional and academic areas in each classroom. Thus, our students have exhibited increased respect for personal space, taking turns, listening and responding appropriately. Our visual arts units exemplify collaborative teamwork among students.  The residencies have made a strong impact on our students by increasing peer to peer respect, building vocabulary and confidence to express themselves in a safe environment. In addition, through dance and rhythm, our students worked through impulse control, sequencing skills, following directions and socialization.  The multisensory nature of the arts is vital to our students most of whom are in psychiatric crisis. We believe in the expressive, creative and therapeutic benefits of engaging through the arts.","Our students are hospitalized for medical, rehab or psychiatric reasons.  Our student population is transient and changes on a daily basis.  Therefore, it is important to mention that the numbers reflect a snapshot of students, but does not truly reflect the attendance for a full school year.  In addition, we do not have students for a full day in many sites so we must integrate the arts into other content areas to address all standards in a short amount of time.  We greatly value the arts and appreciate what the Arts Counts budget affords for our very special students.  Although, capturing growth and data is a challenge for a transient group of students, we see first- hand the power and magic of the arts",mary maher,principal,mmaher2@schools.nyc.gov

Through the arts, students engage in interesting and meaningful activities that are aligned to the learning standards and IEP goals. The year long curriculum serves to expose students to theater, music, dance, visual arts, and poetry. With each unit module, students have opportunity to expand their understanding of the arts reflected in scheduled performances and/or culminating projects. At the start of the school year, students take an interest inventory to identify individual student interests and talents. As a result of these personal inventories, students have been selected to participate in the school band, dance team, step team, art club, and culinary club. To extend learning across content areas, the arts are infused into core subjects. This year, the school had special assemblies to include performances by Young Audiences. P233Q now has a theater group and Step Team. The students participate in the Queens Borough and District 75 Arts Festivals. As several P233Q classes are housed in a community High school, several students have been provided with the opportunity to participate in an after school theater program.",,Elizabeth DeFrancisco,Assistant Principal,ldefran@schools.nyc.gov

Through the art mediums such as music, modern dance, hip hop, yoga, ballet, musical theater, band, chorus and visual arts, students enhance their language, self direction, social skills, reading and life skills as well as performance skills. 

Aside from projects based in literacy, the school has developed several performing arts groups such as a school chorus, keyboard, three drum lines and a dance troupe. We continue to work with the ""EASE"" organization through professional development and online services. This year, the school received the Shubert Arts Grant for theater workshops involving students and their families. Our school participates in a district sponsored yoga program entitled Get Ready to Learn. 176x participates in District 75 arts events. Students participate in monthly assemblies during which they perform or attend performances that help facilitate a positive school culture for students, parents and staff. 

The school has a collaboration with the Disney Organization, where Disney drama educators work with students and staff so that the students may perform the show, ""The Jungle Book."" The entire school community was involved with The Jungle Book production in some capacity. The arts provide a pathway to learning that connects the common core learning standards and the NYCDOE Blueprints for the Arts as well as parent engagement.","The school was highlighted in ""Arts In Schools"" magazine in October, where they highlighted the school's work centered around the arts.

Students participate in a wide range of authentic art experiences to broaden their understanding of various art forms and related careers. Students can be found creating original works of art, performing traditional song or dance and experimenting with media to create an iMovie. During the 2016-2017 school year, P352X has continued its participation in Disney Musicals in Schools. This experience has supported the development of a sustainable musical-theatre program within our school, thereby strengthening our school’s arts program.
