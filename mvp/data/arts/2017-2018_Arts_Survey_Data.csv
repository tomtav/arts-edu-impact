With support from our generous partners and Lowes Toolbox for Education we built a Makerspace and students are ""Making"", every day. Students also enjoyed showing their original art work, for the 2nd time, at the District 1 Art Fair.

Through implementation of the School-Wide Enrichment Model, our faculty have played an integral part in providing sustainable arts programming based on student-interest. They offer art inspired clusters such as “Dance N Beats,"" Dive Into Ocean Art.” “Photography and Beyond,” “The PS 15 Paper Co. and Press,” “Comic Creators,” “Sewing for a Cause,” and “Let’s Make a Movie”. 

We continued our nine-year relationship with Arts for All, Inc, providing our kindergarten through second grade students with opportunities to integrate theater and visual arts into literacy. Other opportunities for expression through dance, music, and theater came through our partnerships with Mark DeGarmo Dance, Third Street Music School, Rosie’s Theater Kids, Children's Museum of the Arts, and puppetry with Arts Connection. In addition, all our students visited arts museums, films and performances to supplement and extend arts learning objectives grown out of classroom curriculum.

Our classroom teachers, cluster teachers, and arts partners work closely to integrate the arts into our units of study. In addition to our many partnerships, we have a school based visual arts teacher and music teacher who meet with all classes once a week. Both arts teachers try to coordinate their curriculum with the literacy and social studies curriculum.  Our Fourth graders dance all year with teachers from the National Dance Institute and have 2 performances for families and the school. In addition, our 5th graders get to be part of Rosie's Broadway Kids; this program gives them the opportunity to take weekly dancer classes for half a year, and attend a Broadway show. Our 3rd graders experience Bollywood Dance with Anja Dance Company, educating the students on the geography, history, and heritage of Indian Dance.  Our Music and Art teachers are active all year teaching all our students to play instruments and different fine arts techniques. This year they will have a Arts Festival Day where they will incorporate all our students work.

We look forward to building on the addition of the visual arts program through the Arts Matters initiative this past year. We expect that this initiative will inspire and encourage students to gain skills and confidence through art and gallery visits. In addition, we will continue to enhance our school environment and culture by encouraging performances and displays that not only celebrate the talents of our students but also create more of a connection and understanding of the various units of study in different curriculum areas. We currently and consistently have student work on display throughout our school building. This enables students to support each other and gain respect for each others work and skills. In addition, we have a middle school art gallery and photography wall which showcases the art work and photography created by our middle school students in collaboration with our community based arts organizations.",,Emily Cruz,Principal's Secretary,ecruz3@schools.nyc.gov

To accomplish this, we strive to secure funding for arts resources and opportunities for our students. Our 2017-18  CBO arts partners include LEAP, Marquis Studios, Rosie's Theatre Kids, Disney Musicals in School, SEA during the day, and teaching artists from The Educational Alliance during our extended day program.  

We believe the arts provide a unique entry point into academics. Given this,  we collaborate with our CBOs to implement arts-infused curricula in core subject areas, as well as providing skills-based arts instruction. PS/MS 188 is designated a NYC DOE Showcase School.  Our Technology/Media Arts program has been highlighted at our regularly held Open Houses for NYC DOE educators and administrators, and commended by Chancellor Farina.  In addition to providing musical theatre programs during our regular school day, we offer an intensive theatre program during after school.

We believe that the arts provide meaningful pathways for success to and in high school, and beyond. Using Renzulli's School-wide Enrichment/Talent Development Model, we provide students with a comprehensive range of experiences in the Arts: Type I (Exposure & Exploration); Type II (Skills Development); Type III (Application of Skills to Real-Life Situations). The arts at PS/MS 188 greatly enrich our student's lives, and provide inspiration and pathways for our students when they move on to secondary school,as well as contributing greatly to our vibrant school culture.","Our school offers a three. year sequence in Media Technology.   This program has been highlighted at our NYCDOE Showcase Open Houses (we are a NYCDOE Showcase School) and has received high praise from former Chancellor Farina.   
This program integrates film-making, animation, podcasting, PSAs with music, Maker Space Technology, and t-shirt design.   

We would like to find out if we can get 'credit' for this sequence.  Currently, the choices for 3-year sequences include only:  Music, Dance, Moving Image, Theatre, Visual Arts. 

Please let us know how we can pursue this.

Art lessons are developmentally appropriate experiences that encourage children to reflect and communicate about themselves and the world around them. The philosophy of our visual arts program emphasizes that all our students are potential artists who view the world from their own unique perspectives. Their experiences of living in the world are communicated through explorations with different arts materials in drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, and sculpture. Our program inspires students to explore a variety of processes and techniques for self expression and communication. Children are encouraged to work independently as well as in collaborative group settings at all grade levels. All art lessons are aligned with the NYC Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts at each benchmark level, the New York State Learning Standards for the Arts and the National Visual Arts Standards. Projects and themes are structured to support the philosophies and perspectives of other disciplines such as math, literacy, science, social studies, language arts and technology.","PS 33 has students in grades PK-5 and is proud to host a diverse community of learners. We work collaboratively to maintain the remarkable achievement that has become the norm for our students. It is home to a rich, standards based curriculum that fosters analytical thinking, creativity, and independence. We use a wide range of resources to provide an holistic and challenging academic program while fostering a welcoming school community. As evidenced through the data here, the school strives to make many and varied connections for all our students by utilizing the vast array of out of school arts and cultural organizations available to public school students in NYC.
Student artwork, art reproductions, picture books and technology are incorporated to assist in achieving the goals of the art program at our school. The artistic development of each child is a blueprint for how we approach the growth of the individual in the classroom experience.  
The art classroom studio provides children a rare and valuable opportunity to express visually their unique feelings, thoughts, and perspectives. Extended time in a studio environment allows for experiences where students can take the time to experiment and create at a developmentally appropriate pace to their needs.  Children learn best when their learning matters to them – when it’s connected to their lives and experiences – and filled with wonder, joy and fun!

Students enjoy coming to school so our attendance rate is among the highest in the city. Our comprehensive program includes our in-house music and art programs and an arts residency program for every child from Pre-K through Grade 5. Many of our arts partnership programs offer scholarships to students who show a particular interest or talent in a discipline and also provide opportunities for them to continue after they leave PS 130. In addition to our day school offerings, we also have many free school-sponsored after school programs: a competitive fife and drum corps, a school chorus, a ballroom dance club, and a Chinese lion dance club. Parents actively support our many programs by volunteering and raising funds to pay for partnerships with Community Based Organizations, musical instruments, and equipment.","All of the arts programs listed in the survey have been made possible by the generosity of our parents and our Parents Association. We are a Title I school with a majority of children coming from homes that speak a language other than English. Because the parents see the value and the positive impact that the arts have had on their children's academic performance, they have been tremendously supportive in helping us to raise the funds necessary to continue the programs. As a result, our school has consistently ranked as one of the higher performing schools in New York City.",Kenneth Mendez,Arts Resource Teacher,kmendez@schools.nyc.gov

designed to prepare students for entrance into specialized arts high schools throughout New York City.
Students begin their visual art instruction in the 6th grade, focusing on developing technical and
conceptual skills that later serve as their foundation across various mediums and projects. In the 7th
grade, students build upon their arts skills, expanding and deepening their inquiry into art-making in the
context of art history and careers in the arts. By 8th grade, students continue to develop their art
portfolios which are a collection of the each student’s best artwork. Advanced students who wish to
pursue further study in visual arts in high school and beyond, participate in an intensive after school
workshop to produce high quality works for their high school audition portfolios. Our goal is to create
beautiful and meaningful artwork that each student is proud of. To that end, students share their work
with their community by participating in semi-annual art gallery shows, as well as throughout the year in
classrooms, hallways and even student shows held in some of New York City’s most prestigious art
museums. The Music Program at Sun Yat Sen Middle School 131 focuses on instrumental music. It is a comprehensive program for grades 6 though 8 intended to prepare students for continued study in high school. Previous experience in music is not required, but students must be willing to study music at an in-depth level.D","Dance EDUCATION: dedicated to developing dancers that are interested in developing into exceptional dance artists. The dance curriculum is designed to create strong technical dancers where skill and confidence are acquired along with a passion for ALL the performing arts. Students develop as professional dance artists, critical thinkers, problem solvers, choreographers, teachers, leaders, and individuals.

These programs provide much needed art opportunities for students to participate in exhibits, performances, and trips to many arts-based institutions. Band members participate in band five times a week, and collaborate in concerts, borough-wide band shows and performances at Carnegie Hall. This year, the senior band visited the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT, attended their concert and had lessons or 'clinic' with the Coast Guard band members and their conductor. A number of 6th-8th grade students have auditioned for and been accepted into Manhattan Borough-Wide and Inner City Band as well as the National Children's Chorus. Non-band students participate in a rotating program of theater and visual arts, following the NYC Blueprint for the Arts and an alignment to the Common Core Standards. Activities in the theatre and visual arts program include but are not limited to: art studio, drama club, museum club, dance performances, digital photography, stop-motion animation (Saturday program for parents and students working/learning together), winter and spring concerts. Some of our students have been accepted into summer art 'intensives' at Frank Sinatra School for the Arts. Wagner proudly puts on a musical for our entire school as well as evening performances for the Wagner community. At Wagner, every student should be equally exposed to the arts as they are to other core subjects to create a well-rounded student. ",,Sheila Gonzalez,Parent Coordinator,SGonzalez132@schools.nyc.gov

They will showcase their learning by using various media (drawing, painting, sculpture, collage) to create art work with some of the principals of design.

Students will also work within the ORFF music program in the upper grades and Music and the Brain keyboarding in the lower ones.

The first unit of Visual Art, “Art Begins With a Mystery"", provides students with experiences uncovering and expressing ideas through visual imagery. In Theater, students begin by learning about storytelling, uncovering the deep connections between design thinking and artistic creativity. Visual Art offers students the opportunity to develop strategies and techniques for making 2D visual art; including proficiency with line and weight, shape and form, value, color, and perspective. In the later half of the class, students will practice and refine these skills in independent works and explore the social and historical context of various artistic expressions. Theater encourages students to extend their expressive and interpersonal skills, building their work in other classes by developing their confidence and comfort presenting to an audience of their peers. Throughout the latter half of the class, students will explore more sophisticated areas of performance, with options ranging from clowning and comedy to the writing, performance, and analysis of Hip Hop poetry. Students will engage with art and art making both in and out of the classroom. They will be expected to produce exhibitions of their own work as well as portfolios of their growth. They will engage artists, art makers, and art spaces in public and community settings in order to explore careers in the arts.

Peck Slip students receive theater and instrumental music instruction with resident artists from cultural organizations, and general music, dance and visual arts instruction from school-based certified arts teachers. The arts are also incorporated into the classroom curriculum, used both as a tool for learning social studies and science content and for demonstrating what students have learned. For example, kindergarten students produce up to four drafts of realistic drawings of moths and butterflies to sharpen their ability to observe these insects and note their distinct features, and third graders build a model of a Lenape village to demonstrate their knowledge of this culture. This year, fourth and fifth grade students are collaborating in a cross-curricular original cabaret supporting their instruction about immigration in social studies. They are integrating their skills in art, acting, voice and dancing in a culminating performance.

o    Inside the Music: In this module, students become classical music composers whose pieces are performed by professional musicians at a final concert.  Through this course, students learn music theory and techniques of composition in order to produce and direct the performance of complex pieces.

Students have visited museums, attended Broadway shows and visited other cultural institutions. We have solicited the professional services of arts organizations such as the Lincoln Center’s LEAD program, the New York City Horticultural Society, Downtown Children’s Museum, and TADA!.

Work-based learning tools are designed to train students in the discipline of the artist while equipping them with a vast array of analytical and creative skills. Talent Unlimited High School believes the goal of training students in the arts transcends the art form itself: we endeavor to prepare our students for the rigors of any professional work environment through disciplined performing arts training coupled with an uncompromising academic education. Our students work closely with various arts organizations and industry professionals, including the American Folk Art Museum, Ballet Hispanico, Circle in the Square, Classic Stage Company, Exploring the Arts, Martha Graham Dance Center, Metropolitan Opera, NYPOPS, Opus Dance Theatre and Community Service, Park Avenue Armory, Pentacle, Paul Taylor Dance center, Theater Development Fund (TDF), and Western Wind Vocal Ensemble. We are also beginning to expand offerings to ensure students are educated as whole artist with depth of understanding in their own art form coupled with breadth in related disciplines. In 2017-2018 we debuted courses opened to students in all studios: AP Music Theory and Theatrical Design. We expanded our partnership with Opus Dance to music and theater students.",,Babette Connor Pisco,Arts Liaison / Work-Based Learning Coordinator,bconnorpisco2@schools.nyc.gov

In weekly music classes, children are creating, singing, and/or performing on instruments. Classes also function as choral ensembles that rehearse for and perform multiple concerts annually. Many third-fifth grade students elect to be in the band program, which consists of keyboards, guitars, woodwind, brass and percussion and performs a repertoire that spans from Latin jazz to contemporary pop. Students in grades 2-5 receive music technology training in which they learn to compose and record music using digital audio workstations and notation software. In addition to music and visual arts, all students perform in end-of-year theatrical performances, and Grades 1 and 4 learn dance from NYC Ballet and 92nd St 'Y'.

We believe that the arts are an excellent platform for our students to explore and gain an understanding of the world around them and a means for them to become active participants in it.They explore personal, global, political, and social perspectives. Students have used the arts as a lens to examine gender issues, social justice, violence against women, climate change, GMO’s, water and food security, immigration,identity and personal expression. Students train as lighting designers, sound designers, and stage managers for school productions and as a paid internship for our theater rentals. We've expanded our arts programming to include Keyboard and Chorus. We have multiple performances throughout the year to showcase the diverse talents of our students; dance concerts, original theater productions, Black History Month performances, talent shows. Our students have performed on Broadway annually as part of Roundabout Theatre Company's Student Theater Arts Festival. Our dance program continues to thrive. We plan to offer Graphic Design and Theater as part of our curriculum in the coming school year. We see the arts as a catalyst for student engagement and an opportunity for deep learning. ","We are a business focus school, so our students take business classes as their elective credits. We expanded our AP courses this year. These courses can cause difficulty in scheduling.

Papermache puppets
Linoleum cut printing
Painted paper masks
Painting on canvas tote bags
A student group also participated in putting on a musical show. They worked with a staff member after school to prepare for this large-scale show. In the show, students sang and played instruments. Students held two performances- one for the student body during the day and one for families during an evening performance.
Finally a group of student participated in a art/ social commentary project- a component of which involved photography as the students took picture in Harlem. These students were flown to California to display their art work and will have another art exhibition in NYC at the end of May.  ","Satellite Academy is a transfer high school serving over-aged and under-credited students. Our school services students with many life difficulties. Virtually all of our students are socioeconomically below the poverty line. 
We focus many of our resources to supporting our students both academically and emotionally. 
Funding is always a challenge. 
We have a F-Status art teacher, who is also training in art therapy, teaching visual arts and have seen success with this program. We wish we could expand it. 
We also have a staff member who worked with students outside of the regular school day to provide music and performance opportunities. This was also a great success.",Jacqueline Grossman,Staff Developer,JGrossman@schools.nyc.gov

We prepare students for college and careers in the arts. Our students receive two periods of art instruction daily for all 4 years that they attend our school. Our programs are NYS approved CTE programs. Included are architectural design, cartooning, animation, graphic design, illustration, digital photography, film and video, and fashion design. Students learn the Adobe and AutoCAD software programs and become certified in both programs. Our facilities mirror the state of the art equipment used in industry and students participate in internships available through industry partners and various arts organizations. They compete in art competitions and display their artwork both in school and in outside venues. Graduating students are accepted into major colleges and universities throughout the country. All our majors have their own gallery shows in the Kenny Gallery throughout the year. We also invite industry professionals to address our students and share their expertise with our students during Career Day and in their studios. Our culminating Spring Arts Festival thoroughly highlights student achievement in the arts and is well-attended by the public and students' families. In addition, our fashion students present a fashion show and the film students showcase their work in their Film Festival","The High School of Art and Design is a Career and Technical High school that serves a diverse group of students who come from all the boroughs in NYC. As such, we provide opportunities for the students to participate in related art fairs and gatherings that showcase the career they might be interested in, for example the  cartooning and animation students attend COMICON and MOCCA FEST; the Photo students participate in Photoville; the Illustration and graphic design students attend the Frieze Art fair on a yearly basis. Technology changes so fast and we need professional development for the teachers who teach the digital software programs to stay abreast of what is taking place in industry.Our programming allows all our students two periods of art on a daily basis from freshmen through senior year.

As 6th graders, our students participate in an arts wheel through which they take 8 weeks of instruction in each of the following art forms: dance, music, digital and visual arts. At the conclusion of their 6th grade year, students participate in a series of auditions and select one of these art forms in which they will specialize over the next two years. Through their three years of middle school our students have multiple opportunities to showcase their artwork: 6th graders demonstrate their work four times throughout the year during morning art exhibitions that are open to families,our 7th and 8th graders share their work twice a year in evening art showcase and performance exhibitions. In all three years of our arts program students perform multiple times for peers, the school community and the public.

Our professional experiences of using visual art as the seed for developing ideas help to expand reading, writing, listening and speaking about visual art and practicing the studio habits of mind in a more profound way. These habits of mind are evident across content areas, in written artists' statements and connections students make between classroom and arts based learning experiences.

Our comprehensive arts program incorporates Common Core Learning Standards, NY State standards, and are Blueprint aligned. We aim to develop the whole child through a rigorous and enriching program that incorporates music, dance, theater and the visual arts into instruction. Students explore, create, and experience the power of music by investigating historical, societal, and cultural themes. Through instruction, they build technical and expressive skills while learning to choreograph and perform dance styles rooted in the understanding of dance across cultures. Students participate in annual dance and musical performances with opportunities to express themselves in set design, choreography and lyrical writing presented to our community and their families. They explore a vast array of artists, art movements and materials through hands-on project-based learning experiences, culminating in a school-wide art show. Children are provided instruction that is interdisciplinary in linking the arts to literacy and social studies by making connections to local and global communities, and culture. Students discover that ideas can be interpreted in a myriad of ways. We celebrate imagination and growth through the appreciation of the arts. We believe that student learning is not confined by the walls of a classroom.",,Rachelle King,Arts Liaison,Rking2@schools.nyc.gov

Through those classes our students are exposed to the arts during the school day, but we find that they want and need more, so we have also expanded our arts programs after school. We offer choir, dance, theater, visual arts and film through our after school program, and our students are so engaged in this work. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our arts program so that we can immerse our students in the arts and tap into their many talents. Every year, more and more of our students are applying and being accepted into high schools that have a focus in the arts such as LaGuardia High School,Talent Unlimited High School,Professional Performing Arts High School, and Grammercy ArtsHigh School",,Lauren Keville,Principal ,lkevill@schools.nyc.gov

Teams of teachers currently work on shared inquiry around instructional practice as related to the integration of arts across the curriculum.  As a Focus school with Lincoln Center Education, the principal and a school-based teacher leader identify an Area of Focus and commit teacher time and resources sufficient to conduct Action Research, as well as analyze findings and report results.  Teachers on the team meet throughout the year to create and present substantive findings, plans and recommendations related to the school’s Area of Focus.  The school’s principal and select teachers attend two Cross-School meetings during the schoolyear, one in January and one in June to represent their work and report on their Area of Focus, as well as to share materials.

To foster this vision, the school community has developed a dynamic and well-organized arts program across arts disciplines that is inclusive of our children's backgrounds and of the world's cultures. We are committed to a vision of the school as a community of learners, who are empowered to create their work and share their process. We achieve this vision by the integration of the arts experiences within classroom curriculum and the broad exposure to the arts through our collaborations with neighborhood cultural institutions. Our school is currently in a vertical grade research project with Lincoln Center Institute with the goal of understanding how to implement the capacities for imaginative learning across cohorts.

These experiences are communicated through explorations with different materials such as drawing, painting, collage, printmaking and sculpture. Not only do the students begin to express themselves creatively, but they begin to learn the language of art, such as line, shape, color and form. 
All art lessons are aligned with the curriculum and standards set forth by the NYC Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, the New York State Learning Standards for the Arts and the National Visual Art Standards. The lessons work to support the standards of other disciplines such as math, literacy, science, social studies and technology. Students are expected to develop their abilities to communicate visually, orally and in written form within the Art Room/Studio. Students begin to play an instrument in grade 2 and by eighth grade have learned to play three instruments.

Our courses focus on using an inter-disciplinary approach to shaping critical art spaces that allow students to explore connections between notions of self and community. Within that process, students are able to re-contextualize both narrative and story through their own use of multi-media and performance as well as use art to explore critical issues that are important to them. Each course has three specific performance challenges and one culminating capstone that function as part of a student’s ongoing portfolio. In addition, teachers at IDP collaborate with outside cultural organizations to offer after school programs in Theater, Spoken Word, Creative Writing, and Video Production. During the 2017-2018 school year, IDP produced two full theater productions and one Spoken Word performance.

All students receive arts enrichment in these areas. Prekindergarten has music, role-play, poetry and movement as integral components of everyday. K-8th grades infuse poetry, music & art into CCLS-based lessons which are developed by the teachers and instructional teams. In addition to embedded school-based visual arts instruction, we have an Arts partnership with the 92nd Street 'Y' that provides stimulating student experiences through choral training that culminates in a district-wide showcase with several participating schools. 92nd St.'Y' also engaged students in visual arts, Hip Hop and musical introduction. This year the 'Dancing in the Classrooms' served 5th grade and company served our middle school population. These dance programs culminate in the school's participation in a citywide competition. Afterschool programs such as the YMCA, Roads to Success, and City Year provide arts exposure via varied dance genres such as hip hop and tap; while the staff enhances support of the arts initiative via after-school Chorus, Flag Corps, Step Squad and Classical Music Appreciation for K-8th grade students.",,Yaira Jimenez,Principal,Yjimene@schools.nyc.gov

As visitors travel through the hallways of our building and observe the fantastic pieces students have created. 

We strive to create environments where students can learn powerful lessons about resilience, ingenuity, and empathy. Engagement in the arts helps students understand the value of sustained effort over time; increases their ability to approach a problem from a variety of angles; and deepens their interest in and ability to relate to other people – all which are of lifelong importance.

Teaching the creative process is at the heart of all of our arts curriculum. Our teachers lead students towards a deep engagement with the creative process: generating original ideas, testing different approaches, collaborating with peers, incorporating feedback, and building resilience as they move towards creating works of art that can be shared with the larger community.

Finally, the arts create a space where students can connect with others who share their interests and passions. The vulnerability and the honesty required to make meaningful art – and the intensity that comes from preparing to share that artwork with others – creates a unique environment where students can come to a deeper understanding of who they are and what they can accomplish.

We also hope to include some Theater program which we may look for as a residency.  Our students will work with their art teachers who will align projects to their core subjects as well as promoting art outcomes including shows, digital displays, concerts and performances for our greater community. We also look forward to continuing Arts Workshops for parents and their children, broadening our scope as a community school. Through the connection to the arts we look ahead to positive and tangible improvements in learning across all educational disciplines. We also hope our Middle School students can connect arts to relevant cultural and career opportunities, providing opportunities for portfolio specials going forward into the new year.  Exciting additions to our programming will include our continued Verizon Innitiative and our new Maker Space which will allow students to explore their potentials as makers and innovators.

Our vision for this partnership is to build a course of study consisting of arts disciplines that are related sequentially and make meaningful connections to the Common Core Standards and Blueprint for the Arts. Through this partnership, we are able reach our goal to make sure that reach every child in the school has access to the arts. We consider the arts crucial to the development of our students, both academically and personally, recognizing that effective arts education addresses the diverse ways in which students learn. We are committed to fostering collaborations between classroom teachers and teaching artists using common language and curriculum goals. The 'Y' also provides professional development to our classroom teachers as well as assessment and evaluation of our arts programs. This year, we again are extending our programs through June through an arts extension grant that has greatly helped expand into other arts disciplines for the students. The students will use what they learned in their art classes to create and produce a school-wide performance combing all art disciplines in classes prek-5. We are looking for additional ways to expand our arts programs for the 2018-2019 school year too including the arts in our new 3K programs for September 2018.

We currently have one full time music teacher who participates in ""Music in the Brain"". This opportunity allows students to cognitively develop skills through the concept of listening to music, playing the keyboard and composing melodies. We have established partnerships with the Society of Educational Arts and CMA. Currently, we have a visual arts program. Visual arts is infused in the social studies curriculum and this year students created community murals. The murals represent who they are in the East Harlem Community.  The artists worked with teachers to integrate the arts in classrooms, using project-based learning to creatively bridge disciplines.  This school year we added a dance program which is led by the Society of Educational Arts. The dance program provided an opportunity for students to learn a number of techniques and dance history.

In addition to our visual arts program with SEA, we also shared our resources with our campus partner PS83. Currently, we are sharing the full time visual arts teacher. Our lower grade students were afforded the opportunity to engage in a year long visual arts program that included developing cognitive skills through the arts. This opportunity has allowed us to ensure that all students across grades K-5 are provided with unique learning opportunities through the arts.
Our plan is to add a full time dance teacher this upcoming academic year. 
","Our school cultural is nurturing and positive. When entering our school you will feel the climate change and see positive interactions throughout the school community.
Our population consists of 41% of students classified as English Language Learners. For this reason, we take the time to write grants that will allow us to provide unique learning opportunities to our second language speakers. It is important for our ELLs to be afforded opportunities to develop language and cognitive skills.
Our school supports content learning which allows our students to enhance critical thinking skills. We promote this by ensuring that Science and Social Studies are taught through exploration and investigations. We use the FOSS program which has allowed our students to engage in hands on investigations. This learning has contributed to our ability to excel in science. We have participated in the District Wide Science Fair and were awarded first place for academic year 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. Our school is making the necessary changes to ensure progress continues to take place.

We also believe that education is a joint venture among students, parents/caregivers and teachers. We see the individual child’s curiosity, abilities and learning styles as integral factors in designing, individualizing and assessing each student’s learning. We believe that the arts are an essential part of the curriculum and that it is important for students to express themselves creatively and to use their imaginations freely. We believe that the uniqueness of children is revealed in their very existence and that it is the school’s responsibility to foster their innate sense of the mystery and joy of life. We encourage children to follow their interests, pursue problems in a way that makes sense to them and defend their conclusion by explaining their thinking in a variety of ways. We understand that there are many kinds of intelligence and the traditional academic, cognitive area is one. Equally important areas of intelligence are: intuition, imagination, artistic creativity, physical expression and performance, sensitivity to others, and self-understanding. To neglect any of these areas is to limit students in the development of their full human potential. We engage students with hands-¬on investigations, projects and design challenges across the grades and subject areas inspiring greater interest, depth and understanding.","Over the last three years the school's Title I population has decreased where 67% of students now qualify for free and reduced lunch.  Consequently, the more affluent families have demanded that the school hire a full-times arts instructor which resulted in a visual arts teacher joining the faculty. Additionally, the affluent families were able to use the personal connections with their employers like the New York Philharmonic or different musical companies to enhance learning in our school community.",Emmanuel Batista,Dean of Development,EBatista11@schools.nyc.gov

In addition, we were awarded a grant through the Office of Arts and Special Projects for 10 acoustic guitars and our scholars are sure to create something special.
At Eagle Harlem, we offer a Modern Jazz Music Program led by Mr. Ekshtut, an accomplished musician with a Bachelor's of Music (Jazz Performance) and a Master's of Music Education from New York University. For 2018-2019, we plan to create a ""music major"" and ""non-major"" specialty tracks for Grades 9-11 - ""majors"" specialize in music theory/band/production while ""non-majors"" choose instrument lab or music production for 1 semester each. Budget permitting, we plan an honors band for advanced students and a state of the Art Music Technology Lab.

Due to our limited resources, we are unable to provide a rich Arts program which includes music and dance, but we currently have a full-time visual arts teacher who provides direct instruction to students in K-5; students in Pre-K receive arts instruction from their classroom teacher. The goals of the art program will be to use all available resources within the community to expose and engage our students in all forms of arts education to extend their learning beyond the classroom, thus enriching their academic and cultural experiences. In order to ensure that our students become literate in the arts, we have established ongoing partnerships with various cultural institutions, including the Apollo Theater, The American Ballet Theater and Broadway Beats, to name a few. Our partnership with these organizations enable our students and staff to fully engage in various art forms which taps students' unidentified talents and interests. Full Arts integration will enrich students learning. Our goal continues to be in encouraging our school-based arts teachers to expand learning opportunities for our students.

Engagement in these disciplines will enhance cultural awareness, promote positive socialization skills, boost self-esteem and positively impact students' capacity in areas such as math, literacy, and science. Through participation in these arts programs, students will recognize and engage in the vibrant historical and artistic community of Harlem. They will also learn about cultural diversity through exposure to music and dance from around the world. Students will have an opportunity to create their own projects in our music and dance studios.

Our Visual Arts program takes a holistic approach to developing the whole artist, where scholars are exposed to Art History and the technical skills required to develop their artistry. Integrated Arts incorporates music, dance, and theater, which afford scholars the opportunity to develop each discipline in a unique way. Additionally, our scholars’ learning is enhanced by field trips, interdisciplinary projects, and service learning activities. Scholars participate in whole-school and grade-level performances where they showcase their creative talents in music, dance, and theater, as well as feature their work in art exhibitions.

During first semester of freshman year, students gain instruction in four areas of the performing arts: Dance, Theater, Technical Theater and Vocal Arts. At the end of first semester of freshmen year, students declare and audition for a performing arts major, which remains their focus throughout their high school career. During that time students have double periods of conservatory study in their major as well as an internship or apprenticeship with a professional artist/arts organization.

Our goal is to encourage our students to use their imaginations to solve problems by nourishing their creative skills. We believe the arts provide entry points into Common Core Learning Standards-aligned curriculum for students and are a vehicle for students to build self-confidence by feeling successful in the classroom and can be a catalyst for increased student motivation and achievement. We are committed to hiring certified arts teachers to lead our arts programming, with a focus on visual arts. We strive to meet the NYS instructional time requirements. In order to allow learning within all four arts disciplines, we partner with cultural organizations, including the Center for Arts Education and Shen Wei Dance Arts. Through these partnerships, students not only reap the benefits of an enriched curriculum, but teachers also have the opportunity to grow professionally through planning and delivering instruction in cooperation with teaching artists, thereby expanding their capacity to integrate the arts throughout the school day for our students.

Our newest initiative, in partnership with The Children's Aid Society, engages parents to learn about and participate in the process of nurturing the innate connections between the arts and childhood development.  

Currently, we offer classes in art and literacy, dance, general music, instrumental and vocal music instruction to students at all levels in grades pre-K through 5th. We produce a fully staged and costumed musical theater production with 3rd-5th graders each year.  After-school activities include Modern Band; in which we explore a wide range of musical genres, including Latin, Rock, and Popular music. We maintain instrument grant-based programming and equipment through Music and the Brain and Little Kids Rock. In-house performances include monthly interactive jazz combos with The Jazz Foundation of America, and yearly performances with the American Classical Orchestra.

Students learn through object-based inquiry and discussions in the classroom and during museum visits which deepens critical-thinking skills and enhances classroom curriculum. Resources such as art making supplies and electronic devices like iPads with museum apps, help students become familiar with a variety of different art forms and hone their ability to observe and discuss their own artworks and the works of art of others. The program is enhanced with regular museum visits and a year-round calendar of exhibitions showcasing students' work. In Theater, Pre-K and K students activate and use their imagination through creative drama activities and storytelling. First graders explore ensemble acting and memorization techniques through participatory stories from different cultures. Second graders develop the actors' instruments: voice, body and mind, while participating in play productions. Third and fourth graders engage in complex acting settings such as full-length rehearsals or scene work to explore theater making processes through various roles: actor, director, designer, spectator and critic. Dual language students in fourth grade are trained in Jacques Lecoq’s Pantomime for Actors Technique, which prepare them for the Experimental Theater course in fifth grade. Other fifth grade classes focus on acting or playwriting, with a specific theme or historic period.","PS 48’s Arts Education Mission Statement

Arts education at PS 48M plays a fundamental role in the individual and social-emotional developmental stages of children. We believe the arts develop self-expression; expand a child’s imagination, creativity, critical thinking, awareness and sensibility for other subjects, disciplines, traditions and cultures; foster global capacities; and improve academic achievement. Our arts education sequential learning focuses on a four-stage cycle: experiencing and understanding art-making processes, developing art-making skills as well as key character values, creating art works, and reflecting and responding to artists, their own work, and  the work of others. Through our program, led and taught by qualified arts teachers and supported by long-lasting partnerships with arts and cultural organizations, we strive to enrich the school environment by embedding arts and culture into the core curriculum.

Second graders learn ukulele and third graders learned recorder. There are at least two musical/ dance performances a year, and we have a full-time dance teacher who serves all our students. Students learn creative movement, cultural dances, and how to collaborate around a presentation in Spanish. As a dual language Spanish/English school, language and culture are reinforced through the arts, both in the classroom and in each specialty areas.

Currently our kindergarten through second grade students receive two periods of keyboard instruction each week. This practice has helped to develop the students' musical abilities as well as their fine motor skills. Our 3rd - 5th graders receive one period of music instruction per week. Starting in third grade, music instruction is connected to the content being covered in the units of studies by the classroom teachers. The other forms of art are addressed by the classroom teachers, Visual Arts teacher, and cultural/ arts organizations during the school day and after school.

At PS 152M, we have two dedicated in-house arts teachers who teach art and theatre arts full time.  We have designated a rooms where we house our art studio and theatre studio.

As a Magnet School, we have designed an afterschool program which are primarily technology focused but we have visual art and theatre clubs.
	
At our school, we display student artwork all throughout our building.  Our 4th and 5th grade students participate in the American Ballroom Theatre (Dancing Classrooms) and Drum Café Programs. The culminating activity of American Ballroom Theatre program is the city-wide dance competition in which our team has placed in first place at the city-wide Rainbow Competition.

As a Children’s Aid Society (CAS) Community School, students enrolled in the CAS After-School Program participate in arts clubs such as drama, folkloric dance, art Lovers, handicrafts, and chorus, and have “Expos” at least two times a year.  Our goals for Arts programming include visits to museums and having our students exposed to the arts through musical and theater performances and cultural events.",,Arnoldo Lorenzo,School Business Manager/ Data Manager/ STARS Programmer,ALorenzo@schools.nyc.gov

We partnered with Studio in School to provide our students with opportunities to learn art with science. We covered topics such as nutrition, animal adaptions and puppetry. In addition, we continue to work with the Morgan Library which provided a summer institute for teachers and two workshops for students. We applied to have a partnership with the MET, which will focus on building professional learning communities. We also have a partnership with Dancing Classrooms to provide ballroom dancing to our 5th grade students. Furthermore, we hired a part-time music teacher and our Parent Association is helping us fund the program. All our students receive quality visual arts instruction from our full-time art teacher. We have a strong commitment to the arts and we believe that the arts are an integral part of a well-rounded education. We feel that developing arts' literacy, vocabulary, and skills support learning across the curriculum. We hope to instill in our students a lifelong appreciation for the arts.

Our students embrace the opportunity to learn and become well-rounded individuals by learning from not only our skilled faculty but from many outside providers such as City Kids, YANY, and Art Hoppers as well. As we look towards the upcoming school year, we look to focus on the following goals: Instrumental Music: Continue to advance ability to play instruments by teaching the students music theory, appreciation, and presentation. Students in grades 5-6 will show their growth by performing for an audience of their peers and parents/guardians, while students in grades 7-8 may chose to perform in the annual talent show. Vocal Music: Continue to create unique and original content that aligns to curriculum and addresses the social and emotional needs of students in grades K-4. Students in the elementary school will have the opportunity to perform, while students in grades 5-8 may continue to build their vocal abilities by participating in the Intermediate School Choir. Visual Art: Continue to introduce Art to students in grades K-8 by allowing them to express themselves through painting, sculpting and collage building. Through a series of cycles, students in grades K-4 continue to build on their knowledge and skillset by working with outside providers. ",,Cynthia Chory,Principal,cchory@schools.nyc.gov

Our Music program offers instruction in general music, steel drum band, string ensemble, recorder ensemble, and chorus. This year our school received a generous grant to implement and maintain a music education program and curriculum on the model developed by Music and the Brain (MATB).  All of our Kindergarten and First grade students participate in MATB classes for two periods per week with a MATB trained and licensed music teacher providing instruction using keyboards.   Our Visual Arts program integrates Common Core content, enriching concept and knowledge, and exposing students to various forms of art mediums and experimentation.

The Arts hold a prominent place at Hamilton Grange Middle School, and for that reason we are committed to making the visual and digital arts as well as music, dance and theater part of our regular school day and afterschool programming. Our commitment to the arts is twofold: (1), we want students to find their passion while here at Hamilton Grange, and through it build the discipline and work ethic necessary to be successful in whatever endeavor they choose. (2), we know that training in the arts is beneficial to the whole child-for instance, sustained learning in music and theater correlates strongly with higher achievement in both math and reading, art studies and activities help keep high-risk dropout students to stay in school, new brain research shows that not only does music improve skills in math and reading, but it promotes creativity, social development, personality adjustment, and self-worth.

Our education is rigorous and provides enriching learning experiences in and out of school.  Our mission is supported by an arts program that includes: visual art, music, dance, vocal and orchestra. In our visual arts program, students can communicate at a foundational level. This includes knowledge and skills in the use of basic vocabularies, materials, tools, techniques, and intellectual methods of the discipline. Our goal is that our students can communicate proficiently in at least one art form, including the ability to define and solve artistic problems with insight, reason, and technical proficiency.

Music/Orchestra Goals

1. To acquire skills in listening, describing, reading, performing, and creating in order to promote aesthetic response. 
2. To acquire and apply musical knowledge. 
3. To take the initiative to select, understand, and appreciate music as an art form. 
4. To gain insights into many cultures and eras. 
5. To develop the ability to make qualitative judgments relative to music.

Our Dance Program is designed to provide students with movement skills that will increase their flexibility, strength, and aerobic endurance. Emphasis is placed on learning the fundamental skills required for dance training while enjoying the physical benefits. In addition, students will have have many performing opportunities.

Our Theater Arts program ended while we reinstated our partnership with Creative Art Works.  Creative Art Works offered after school classes in Sneaker Design and Urban Design. Also, we continued our relationship with Alvin Ailey Dance Theater.  Alvin Ailey taught after school Afro-Cuban dance workshops.

New partners joined us in 2018.  The Gibney Dance program worked intensively with a small group of students during the spring.  We also worked with the Sugar Hill Art Museum to collaboratively produce a mural.

Within the school day schedule, a proportion of our students received  arts instruction.  In this class, students studied the technique of a well known artist then produced a piece based on the artist's technique. In addition, one of our teachers piloted a weekly class focused on music theory and percussion.  The instruments used in this class were donated to the school.  

Our goals are to continue to strengthen the three year sequence of Arts courses as well as build stronger arts partnerships. Finally, we will build ""rigor"" in the Arts by developing more comprehensive arts assessments such as rubrics, peer assessments, timely teacher feedback to students, and performances.","CMSP 328 is located in the community of Washington Heights and draws students from here as well as Inwood, Harlem, and Bronx communities. These communities have undergone demographic shifts that mirror changes that are occurring in New York City generally. CMSP 328’s student population is diverse by every measure:
Our current enrollment is approximately 250 students from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Columbia, Ecuador, Mexico, Haiti, Guyana, and the United States. Our largest language group is represented by speakers of Spanish with over 100 students. A notable demographic shift is the increase in the number of Arabic speaking students from countries like Yemen (we currently have 11 Arabic speaking students). Another represented language group speaks Haitian-Creole. According to our School Performance Dashboard, our demographic statistics are: 1% Asian, 13% Black, 84% Hispanic, and 1% Other.  Our percentage of students who are considered ELLs is over 60% while almost 40% of our students have IEPs.

Students in our middle school are exposed to each of the arts we offer: dance, music and visual arts. At the end of middle school, students choose a specialty, such as- dance performance, dance concepts, band, chorus, art studio, etc. Students also have the opportunity to take AP Studio Art as upper-class men/women. 

While funding across the city is being cut and the arts are being marginalized, CHAH has invested in a brand new dance studio, in addition to the existing, fully equipped, state of the art visual arts studios and music rooms. Students have full access to imaging, audio and digital media software on various platforms. Most importantly, CHAH has three full time arts teachers who embody the soul of our arts programs by working with community institutions to bring art alive for our students.

Our community strongly believes in a well rounded student that can speak to all the arts, and can demonstrate their mastery in public performances and expositions. We strongly believe in the arts being a shared, public experience.",,Amir Tusher,Assistant Principal,atusher@schools.nyc.gov

In art foundations, students learn how to establish the elements and principles of design and apply basic level drawing and design skills from a large scope of art genres. In drawing and painting students are encouraged to use symbolic themes within their work to create deeper meaning.. In advanced art, the goal is to prepare students to work professionally for future study of art after high school and to develop their own artistic voice. Students of all grade levels receive additional support at the art club offered twice a week. The College Academy’s music department is a campus-wide music program has begun in earnest with the establishment of the George Washington Band. Students learn the fundamentals of music performance through playing a wind instrument with a large group of other musicians. Students learn basic music theory and performance techniques in a collaborative environment, and perform as a group 3-5 times a year. Our ultimate goal at GW is to build a large, thriving music program with a variety of course selections and performance opportunities, and to create life-long enthusiasts, composers and performers of music.",,Meghan McDonough ,Art Liaison ,mmcdonough2@schools.nyc.gov

School’s Arts Program Description 2017-2018
(To be published in Arts Report)
We offer a rigorous art program designed after top NYC arts schools. The students participate in a studio arts type curriculum based strongly on NYC Common Core Standards as well as NY State and the NYC DOE's Blueprint arts criteria. The Arts curriculum implemented not only by the arts teachers but also by the classroom teachers helps provide a solid arts foundation. We promote the integration of the arts into our curriculum in all subject areas including Math and Science. Our students are exposed to various arts genres during classroom activities, residencies, and through the incorporation of trips to various cultural organizations. We are a school focused on college readiness and our arts program reflects our expectations as well as our goals for our students' futures.",,ZOILA CORDOVA,ART LIAISON,ZCORDOVA@SCHOOLS.NYC.GOV

Our Arts Program consists of a Glee Club, upper-grades Dance Group and African Drumming. We also partner with New Victory Theater & Studio-in-a-School for visual arts and dance to support our English language learners. Students are able to cultivate a deeper understanding of different cultures as they explore world music and other expressions of performing arts. We believe the Arts to be at the core of our curriculum, enhancing the potential of contiguous exploration of various mediums of self expression. As a school community, our staff bands together in support of the arts. Due to budget constraints, several teachers volunteer their time to conduct various art programs before and after school. We look forward in securing any grant monies available to expand our current art program to include visual art and musical programs for all students. We believe that the Arts help students to make basic connections between curriculum and practical text-to-self applications. Our past partnership with the Morgan Library’s Book Project continues to inspire our upper grade students in the production of their own personal narratives in the literary genre of the illuminated manuscripts. Students learn how primary colors for the manuscripts were obtained (maintained in an ink garden) and how we can duplicate similar methods today to obtain our own colors for illustrating. We believe heavily in the arts and seek monies to invest in other programs.

","We service the poorest congressional district in the nation. Situated in the heart of the South Bronx neighborhood of Mott Haven our overall population is predominantly comprised of English language learners. We have observed that our Arts clubs have decreased the rate of violent incidents in the school to a bare minimum. We desperately need the Arts. Through the Arts students are able to make basic text-to-self connections that assure their academic success and save lives.

In continuance of our embrace and provision of arts related programs and services to our student body we also have teachers trained and implementing the Visual Thinking Strategies program. PS 30 continues to engage the entire student body via during a weekly Club Hour program featuring Visual Arts, Glee, Performing Arts, Book Making, Photography, Cheerleading and Dance programs. Teachers on every grade also prepare programs for monthly thematic assemblies via musical, choral and dramatic performances. The Arts continue to be at the center of our core curriculum. We will continue to form partnerships with cultural and community organizations that specialize in bringing the arts in their varying forms to all of our students as well as securing private funding to ensure the continuation of many of our programs.

We also used the Arts to improve student motivation, self-esteem, cognitive skills and verbal skills through the different programs that we have in our school, such as: the Education Through Music, Anne Frank Center, and through our teachers who follow the Blueprint for the Arts.

The music teacher and LCE teaching artist worked together throughout the year with the students focusing on how the arts can support language acquisition.  Inquiry findings will be shared with all 1st-5th grade teachers in order for them to understand the Aesthetic Education Framework and LCE Capacities that students are using across arts disciplines.  Our music teacher and our students have an established rapport and understanding of rituals and routines that prioritizes students’ well-being and sense of safety.

Students attended trips and participated in after school programs that related to music, theater, visual arts and media. Our goal for the future is to increase our arts programming to create a more well-rounded arts education, if budgeting allows.","Carly Ayala, our community school director, has implemented arts programming during the school day and after school. Grades K-5 received instruction through programming from the Salvadori Center. While the description of the program relates to Math and Science, it had an arts component where students used clay to create sculptures. Our school is currently undergoing expansion. We are looking forward to the installation of a mural by Sandy Litchfield in the main lobby. Since the status of our school is currently not Title 1, we rely on funding from outside sources, especially through our local politicians. While we cannot predict the future, we can hope that once the expansion is open, arts funding may increase.",Kerry Silva,Art Teacher,jjasilva16@gmail.com

Our staff members are available to work with any student who decides to apply to a High School that specializes in the arts by offering assistance with auditions and/or portfolios. Our halls are festooned with the artwork of our students and we conduct concerts throughout the year celebrating our dance and instrumental programs.

We are unwaveringly encouraging our students to take risks and to believe in themselves as the tools to reach their full potential. 

Being cognizant that the route to success is multi-faceted, we try to immerse our students in meaningful art experiences by infusing other disciplines into art lessons, exposing them to our Artist in residence, providing museum trip, displaying the works of ‘Old Masters’ in our hallways, and inviting parents to participate in our in-house art exhibitions and theatrical performances. They also take ownership of our art endeavors by playing significant roles, via in-house art competitions, in designing programs and posters/flyers, decorating for in-house events, and assisting in curating in-house exhibitions, all of which we plan on increasing.
 
It is our resolute belief that this holistic approach, by addressing their physical, intellectual, emotional and social well-being, will enhance their academic abilities and increase their level of exploration and discovery as they climb the educational ladder and beyond. Moreover, it is instrumental in highlighting the various art-related opportunities available, and also to foster a lasting appreciation for the arts, whether as an artist, future audience member, or a patron.

Students also audition for the annual fall drama production and spring musical that engages students in all areas of theater, including acting, set design, stage management, and lighting. The year ends with a culminating ArtsFest where the entire school community celebrates the many areas of the arts by hosting teacher and student led workshops, which includes an improve showcase, sneaker painting workshop, t-shirt making, and a wide variety of other activities. 
Our goal for next year is to expand the arts program into the afterschool space where students can specialize in their area of interest. 
Another goal is to expand the arts into the middle school so that students will be able to specialize at an earlier age and become more competitive by the time they reach high school in order to advance to local and national competitions. ",,Dawn Verhille,Principal ,dverhille@schools.nyc.gov

Inside Broadway is a professional theater company that works with grades PreK-5; each grade performs a culminating production based on a Broadway theme. Students learn the elements of Theater (Choreography, Voice, Drama) to give them a good foundation of how a Broadway production is put together. Every year the 4th and 5th graders go to a Broadway Show and also tour behind the scenes!  Finally, all our classroom teachers involve their students in the Arts through monthly grade-wide assembly performances. Culminating projects often include visual, musical or video 'share-outs' related to the topic of study.

Our classroom teachers are encouraged to and enjoy taking students on field trips to concerts, plays, and, musicals in order to enrich arts-based learning.  Our student community is comprised of students of various cultural backgrounds, ELLs, bilingual learners, and students who receive Hearing Education Services.

Through an Arts Matters Grant we were able to bring on a Theater and Dance teacher shared with another school so that we could offer all 4 Arts disciplines. Students spend 1 quarter in each of the 4 Arts disciplines (Art, Music, Dance and Theater)in the 6th grade and in the 8th grade.  In 7th grade they are exposed to one quarter each of 2 out of the 4 arts disciplines. Some students in grade 9 get their 2 arts credits, majority get at least 1 of 2 in the 10th grade. Students get their second arts credit in the 10th or 12th grades. Within scheduling constraints -students in grade 9 get art and music, 10 and 12 which one depends on which class they are in with limited choice in 12th grade","There is a semester 3/2, 2/3 rotation for the shared Dance and Theater teacher with another school.  The Art and music teachers are here full time.  Given the reduced days the Dance and Theatre are here, it limits how we can give those arts and where they can fit in the class schedule. So each class grade 6 and 8 each rotate for 1 quarter into each discipline for a 2x per week class.  7th grade only does 2/4 for one semester bc they need to take health in the spring term. The outside Dance provider is here 2x per week for grades 6,7 and 9 and each class on the grade rotates for 1 quarter into the class given with the PE teacher as part of their PE program.  Grade 10 gets health in the fall so in the spring they can get some arts electives.  12th graders can choose Arts electives versus other electives since they have the flexibility in the 12th grade.

Little Friends is designed to connect the people of Highbridge to the bridge for which their community is named and to the two parks that are joined by the bridge. It encourages teachers to use the story of the High Bridge as a tool to teach history and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math). Programming focuses on teaching local Highbridge children about the history, significance, and the beauty of the High Bridge, as well as introducing the local flora and fauna that can be found along the nearby Harlem River and the importance of water to all who use the river. The overall goal of the program is to foster a love and appreciation for this natural resource in hopes that children will be inspired to become stewards of their environment.

The after school program(SCAN), has supported us in financing a Drama Club. Our revitalized ‘state of the art’ auditorium has been put to good use re-establishing school concerts. Next year (2018/19) we hope to continue our relationship with Jazz at Lincoln Center from previous school years and also  take 4th and 5th grade students to participate in arts education events sponsored by the MET and El Museo del Barrio. Finally, we are planning to put on a school musical. ",,Craig Monteverde,Assistant Principal,cmontev@schools.nyc.gov

Next year we hope to extend this more, bringing additional members of our community into our school.

Instruction across all disciplines is aligned with or surpasses benchmarks outlined in the NYC Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts. Students have additional access to arts programs provided by our school's Arts specialists in a variety of arts-based afterschool programs (not discussed in this survey) It is our goal that our students continue to find success and grow both as performers and artists , pursuing the Arts well after they leave our school as artists, advocates, or appreciators. We hope to provide these opportunities through the continuation of our current programs in the upcoming school year.","Our school is an early childhood school (K-2) located in the Bronx.  We have 4 classes per grade with 1 class per grade being bilingual and 1 being ICT.  Since our school is so small, all classes are able to participate in all arts programs offered.

In order to support this vision, we have identified and developed an art studio, a classroom solely purposed with being the space to provide visual arts instruction from our visual arts licensed teacher. In addition to the day-to-day incorporation of the arts, we also have two Project Arts after school programs.  One is theater based and the other is visual arts based.

This process has fostered further community awareness and hopes to provide the structure and catalyst for sustainable relationships between the Shakespeare School and key arts stakeholders.

All classes receive instruction in Vocal music and many begin to explore Instrumental music through the use of recorder. Our Choir and African Drum Band meet after school and perform in many venues throughout the city. We host several artist residencies throughout the year that provide experiences in the visual and performing arts. Children have opportunities to experiment with different artistic media and to express themselves through Drama and Storytelling. Classroom teachers integrate Visual Art into all areas of the curriculum, using the Blueprint for the Arts to guide their selection of materials and artistic method.

Students will enhance and develop performance skills in improvisation, theatre games, spoken word, physical theatre and vocal work; they will increase their abilities as imaginative and analytical actors by interpreting the texts of dramatic works. Additionally, students will gain new performance skills needed to help build characer in monologues and scenes. These classes will prove an enjoyable outlet for self-expression, group interaction, and an opportunity to explore personal meaning and identity. After school, the Department produces two full scale Musical Theatre productions each year. Students audition and are chosen to sing, dance and act among their fellow ensemble members. Technical theatre work is also offered, where students may help design, build and paint the sets. Every Fall and Spring, the Theatre Department partners with the Theatre Development Funds' Stage Door Program. Through this program, students collaborate with a TDF teaching artist and attend a Broadway show for free.","Due to generous support from PDT Partners we were able to incorporate an Arts Night at BCSM in 2018 that we look to continue for 2019.

Classes are designed to develop drawing, observational and analytical skills through exploration of the Elements of Art and Design in varied media. Units begin with introductory techniques and concepts and progress to complex final group and individual hands-on projects. In addition, set design production offers students the opportunity to delve in careers in the Arts through participation in Disney in Schools programming. The overall goal of the Art program is to teach skills that enable students to make connections across content areas and engage in self-expression. Students demonstrating strong artistic potential and interest are encouraged to pursue portfolio preparation for specialized high schools and are supported by participating in extension Art classes and enrolling in the MS Arts Audition Boot Camp provided by Lincoln Center for the Arts.",,Emily Perez,Art Teacher,msperez@mycis303.com

Heightened awareness of creative thinking helps our scholars to develop their self-reflection skills in all classes and become more self-regulated learners. At Mott Hall, students have the opportunity to learn through art making and art history. Through the arts, students create, perform, and present in ways that engage and convey feelings, experiences and ideas. It is through these creative thinking practices that students can learn new skills and master skills they have already developed through their own personal artistic practice. ","In the International Baccalaureate Program, students are required to receive a total of 50 hours of arts programming per year.

At HSVD, students and staff work together to provide opportunities that meet the needs of every learner. One of the major ways in which our school has grown in regards to the Arts has been through continued expansion of our offerings to students. Our Music department offers a full Orchestra program, where students have a choice of Violin, Viola, Cello, or String Bass. Some of the Music Department's goals for next year include having our music students perform both solo and in ensembles at the New York State School Music Association competition. We won the silver for the 3rd time.  We continue to offer a Visual Arts component; students have learned sublimation and heat transfer with vinyl, leading to the creation of: T-shirts, pants, sweaters, mugs, plaques and other items as well. We continue to build relationships with cultural organizations such as Alvin Ailey, and Dance Theater of Harlem. This year we have also partnered with Hamilton, where students studied the time period and created their own performances. Project I.AM continues to be an important part of our school, where students create and deliver individual and group performances before a live panel of judges who provide feedback based on a school-wide performance rubric. Students receive feedback and are then expected to revise their performances accordingly.","Our students come to HSVD with no prior experience in music or dance.  Since we are not an audition school, our students are learning the very basics of their craft.  The Orchestra program begins with the very basics of playing a string instrument. Our students are so dedicated to their learning their craft; so much so, that they have won the silver in the NYSSMA competition; they won this year, 2018, 2017, and 2015.  They've competed three times and won the silver each time.  In dance, students are learning ballet, jazz, hip hop and the dance terminology.  As they progress through the years, they learn how to choreograph their own dances and perform these choreographed dances at the end of each academic year.  
While our students excel in the arts, they also come from backgrounds that require them to have adult responsibilities at a young age.  Many of our students need to work after school, take care of their siblings, and complete other adult responsibilities.  Some of our students live in shelters with their families or on their own.  With this said, sometimes its difficult for some of them to progress in the arts due to lack of rehearsal on their own  time because of their circumstances; however while in school, they give their very best.",Michelle Yvette Madera,Teacher/Arts liason,mmadera3@schools.nyc.gov

The dance teacher engaged students in ballet and modern dance styles. The music teacher offers music across cultures, Latin music, Gospel and Jazz are some of what it students learned about in music. Some of visual arts offerings to students included drawing, painting, sculpting with clay and print making. 
       The joy of it all is watching what the students learn across the disciplines come together on stage. Twice a year, collaborate efforts produces a dance musical with scenery. The dance teacher picks a story that her students reimagine in dance. The music teacher finds accompanying music to be played by students on recorder, piano (keyboard) and sung by chorus. After reading and discussing the text for our production the fifth grade students designs and creates the set for the show. It's a fun way to teach students that the arts work together and to expose them to different jobs that are offered in the arts.
       We will continue to teach our students and expose the to the vast world that are has to offer them. The Arts Blue Prints and Common Core Standards have been a great guide. Continued professional development in diversifying the use of these tools to reach our students in the arts is a goal we will continue to strive for to offer our students our best.",,Nicole Jones,Art Teacher,Njones3@schools.nyc.gov

In our music program we have avery longstanding relationship with Music and The Brain where are students are taught how to play the keyboard primarily in grades k-2. Our Music program also includes The Little Kids Rock program  which we use primarily to instruct students  to play the guitar in the upper grades. Our visual arts program has been a mainstay at the school and our students are instructed in several different mediums in all grades. Our Dance program is instructed across all the grades through an in house teacher where students get a very rich instruction in dance form and technique. Our school also benefits greatly from our long standing relationship with The DreamYard Project. This year they have supported us through in class residencies, teacher professional development and a very enriching after-school program. In consort all of these different arts programs are used in our school to make it a very culturally inclusive environment and our students are not only scholars but young artist.

This year we increased our opportunities to work with the DreamYard Project with the focus on visual arts and dance.  We have also begun working with Little Orchestra designed to engage 2nd grade students in music education.  Visiting artists have been working directly with selected classes and with parent groups as part of community outreach in the Arts and have also been conducting afterschool programs. Our students have will be exhibiting artwork in the 2017 Bronx Borough-Wide Annual Visual Arts Festival and the DreamYard Visual Arts Festival at Lehman College, where they will exhibit artwork at the Lehman College Art Gallery. We have a second grade teacher who provides Music instruction- he also conducts a student Rock Band as well as directing a theatrical performance in the spring. Connections are continuously made with the Common Core subjects to support Learning through the Arts.","Public School 54 is known as The Academy of Creative Minds.  We make it our mission to prepare our students for the 21st Century through the use of technology in the classrooms for purposes of instruction and assessment.  As a school community, we are engaging our students in the Cloud 9/PBIS program to improve our school community through it's teaching.  In this, our students participate in the practice of citizenship through respect, responsibility, perseverance and compassion for all.  We set high expectations for all of our students with the belief that they can and will achieve their goals academically and socially.  We are working with various organizations to build on our students use of creativity through the arts to expand their understanding of the various disciplines in art while also making those connections to other subject areas such as literacy, math and social studies.  Our science teacher has a Sustainability Club to teach students about environmental studies to make them aware of these issues affecting our environment and what we can do to correct them. In addition, our teachers work each day to expand upon their best practices with the assistance of Teacher's College and the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines to provide students, through our instruction, multiple means of engagement, representation, action and expression to reach students with various learning needs.

This year more families were able to participate in the Studio in a School Family Workshops offered on Saturdays. The program ended with a beautiful art exhibit which everyone enjoyed. 
Seeing the enthusiasm and artistic talents grow with time, we have begun offering after school enrichment arts programs. This structure provides opportunities for more students to engage in dance, music and visual arts. 
Another way our arts program has expanded is by taking advantage of opportunities to attend events outside of the school as well. This year our students in Kindergarten- Third grade attended 1-2 performances offered by the Arts on Stage NY organization. 
We will continue to expand upon these opportunities each year in hopes of nurturing an appreciation for the arts in all of our students. ",,Carolyn  Heredia,Principal ,cheredi@schools.nyc.gov

Living with the elements of art gives students freedom to acquire self-esteem and self-mastery furthering creative momentum. Through direct involvement in an integrated Arts curriculum, students make connections with their daily lives, i.e., Math and Art, Science and Art, History and Art. Self-direction within art classes allows students to express themselves while building problem-solving skills and developing techniques used in making art: descriptive language, analysis of purpose, interpreting feelings, evaluation of art projects. Collaboration with various New York City world-class cultural organizations provides an opportunity for students to build a global arts foundation. P.S. 86 has worked with the Guggenheim ""Learning Through Art"" since 1997, accruing twenty-one years of exhilarating art making. (Our students art work is exhibited in The Guggenheim every May.) The P.S. 86 vendors list reflects the enriching quality of vendors who integrate the Arts, life styles and cultures of students, teachers and parents. Parents, families and friends are enthusiastic supporters of the visual and performing arts presented by the P.S. 86 school community throughout the year.          ","In the spring of 2017 P.S. 86 implemented a new program for Special Education called ""Fly High"". The program targeted Special Education classes: kindergarten through third grade. (The program was based on acquiring self-esteem and mastery not only in the classroom, but in alternative spaces such as gallery studio workshops and museums.) Organized through arts residencies, activities were coordinated with the 86 curriculum. Professionals in the Special Needs spectrum were invited to observe and conduct classes for these students. This year, in the Fall of 2017, the Special Education classes in grades four through six, were invited to complete the cycle with residencies conducted at the Lehman College Art Gallery. The ""Fly High"" program is regarded as a success with classroom teachers and students looking forward to the continuation of the program in 2018 and 2019.

Our vision is to prepare our scholars in all facets of Dance, building movement and vocabulary skills as well as creating, performing and responding to Dance. The program was further enriched by a Dance Theatre of Harlem partnership which played an integral part in the implementation and connection of the Arts to a vision of college and career readiness path for the scholars. This was made possible with the assist of the Arnhold New Dance Teacher program. The Arts curricula will continue to build on itself as the foundation of Fine Arts are explored, making connections in Art and its practices to many master artists through modern art movements of the newly developed Warwick House of Street Art. LeAp is still a valuable part of the extra-curriculum vein of the school. They add Multi-Media, Cosmetology, Robotics, Fashion, Arts & Crafts, even Cooking.

We believe that the role of the school and the home is to provide a climate that enhances the students’ cognitive, creative, and social growth, thereby increasing the child’s potential for success. Plans for the cultural arts initiative build upon the concepts that P.S. 291 has nurtured in our school: to support and sustain standards-based programming embedded in curriculum, supporting literacy and providing opportunities for our students to creatively express themselves using the four arts disciplines -- music, dance, visual arts, and theater. The visual and performing arts have played an important part in our school community for years. Art instruction is aligned with the art standards.

Our Visual Arts teacher  and Dance teacher develops integrated Arts units that are designed to enhance the New Arts Standards and align to the New York City Arts Blueprints. Through creating, performing, responding and connecting, students are able to develop their art skills and imaginations. Students learn to understand how others express themselves through Music, Dance and Visual Arts. Our students learn to share ideas and emotions and learn how to turn those into images, sounds, and actions. As our students create artistically through the Arts, they become more imaginative and strengthen their problem-solving skills.",,Darryl  Harrington,Principal,dharrington3@schools.nyc.gov

Our Arts program continues to be enriched by both a CASA Grant (thanks to Councilman Cabrera) and a SPARK Educational Grant from The New Victory Theater.  These 2 grants have given all our students the opportunity to participate in 14 week arts residencies.  For the 2017-18 school year, the CASA grant gave our K-2nd graders the opportunity to participate in dance residencies with teaching artists from The Town Hall and our 5th graders the opportunity to work with a theater artist and create their own scripts.  CASA Grant residencies all culminated with performances for families. 3rd and 4th graders worked with 2 New Victory theater teaching artists for 14 weeks and attended 3 performances at The New Victory Theater.  For the 5th year, we had a Musical Theater Revue, consisting of 3rd, 4th and 5th graders who auditioned to become cast members.  They worked with both a theater and music teaching artist and culminated their residency with 3 performances (2 for their peers and 1 for their families). For the 9th consecutive year we held 2 Saturday Family Arts' Institutes; one for K-2nd grade & one for 3rd – 5th grade.  This year’s art projects centered on S.T.E.A.M. projects (Science Technology Engineering Art Math)such as lighthouses, merry-go-rounds, bridges and electric robots.","We are a small non-DOE building that is over-utilized.  We have no space for dance practices and only one gym and no yard which creates scheduling conflicts.

This year we partnered with the Lehman Collage Arts Department to incorporate our immigration curriculum with our visual arts curriculum.  Students had the experience of learning social studies content through different mixed media as well as take multiple gallery tours. During the year, we also had a genre of arts programs through our relationship with Marquis Studios.  These programs have exposed our students to different mediums such as architecture, film making drumming and puppetry.  This opportunity allowed our students to see how art is intertwined into many different aspects of learning and their world. We will continue our relationship with Dancing Classrooms to help students achieve social awareness and build relationships with their peers.

Furthermore, the high school art teacher also runs an after school Art club, and organized a three-visit partnership with the Museum of Modern Art. High school students also visited the Bronx Art Museum and the MET Museum. The middle school participated in visits to the MET and Lehman College Art Gallery, and four middle school classes received a series of nine workshops through the Lehman College Art Gallery residency.The school year will end celebrating the year with our our school-wide arts exhibition, which will be in displayed throughout the hallways in mid-June.",,Beatriz Szmurlo,HS Art Teacher,BSzmurlo@schools.nyc.gov

Our Art program allows children to work with a large range of materials and media, and develop skills and knowledge of art concepts. Much of the work is in collaboration with classroom teachers, and expands on the themes being learned in students' classrooms. In Music, children learn an expansive repertoire of songs. They explore notation, beat, and rhythm using their voices as well as instruments.

Our Arts program continues to allow students to develop creatively and challenge their knowledge of style, artistic and cultural contributions to the world of the Arts. We support the individual talents that students posses in Music performance, Music Theory and Visual Arts. We accomplish this through integration of curriculum across the content areas, while maintaining high expectations through standards-based education. Keeping with the Common Core standards, Math and Literacy continue to play an important role. As students use skills in measurement, experimentation, reading comprehension, expand vocabulary and defend opinions through arguments while exposed to a variety of text, visual representations lead student discussion and dialogue as they acquire meaning. We prepare students during the middle school years to be armed with the tools and achievement expectation that will afford them successful paths in high school and college.",,G.ceballos ,School Social Worker ,gceball@schools.nyc.gov

These groups are preparing for the spring concert. Our fall play: The Glass Menagerie was a big hit and our spring musical: The Drowsy Chaperone is in rehearsal for a late May performance. S!NG gave a smashing performance of hysterical spoofs written and performed by its many members. Our students have participated in our annual Mask Creation Contest, Japanese Singing Contest and were winners in many photography contests. Many of our artists have been recognized in myriad contests around the city.

After two required visual art courses, our students take art electives. We have an Art Club to provide greater access to studio time for each student. Two days a week there is art instruction and five days a week there is guitar instruction during the lunch period. The Parents’ Association also enjoys art-making experiences.
     We aim to nurture a school culture that is supported by commitment to our students’ creativity and their thoughtful, reflective participation in the community. This year, one of our students attended the seven hour Saturday Program of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and created work along with other top art students in our city that culminated with two gallery exhibitions. Two of our students participated in the Bronx Borough Art Exhibition at Lehman College and students submitted work for the prestigious PS Art Competition.
Our art teacher facilitates the “Arts Mondays” Professional Learning Community for Bronx Secondary school art teachers. Thus, our school administration both supported the Chancellor’s Vision to build highly effective systems for evaluating students’ academic growth and persistence with optimal cognition using Art Studio Habits of Mind as identified by Howard Gardner’s Project Zero. We furthered our partnership with Lehman College Art Gallery which was supported by an Arts and Family Engagement grant.

As part of our commitment to provide a quality education to all students, we believe in arts education. Our partnership with Education Through Music has given our students the opportunity to have formalized general music instruction in all grades and to participate in various concerts and performances. In addition to formal music instruction, our 5th grade students participate in weekly band lessons as well. Students in grades K-5 also receive visual art instruction by a certified visual art teacher. Additional partnerships with Alvin Ailey Dance Company allow us to expose our students to other art forms. We will continue to make connections between the arts and all disciplines. We will continue with our vision to increase arts education for all students in grades K-5.

Over the past ten years, we have experienced great success through our partnership with Notes in Motion. Each year the cooperating teachers and the dance instructors meet to determine the focus for the year. This allows the teaching artists to connect their lessons to an academic focus area. In addition, this year we have expanded the program to include a Parent Dance Workshop, where parents had the opportunity to learn some of the dance pieces their children learned. 
Our second partnership has been with Inside Broadway: This is a theater residency with identified fourth and fifth grade students. Here students are given the opportunity to create and perform in their very own musical. This residency helps to bolster our students’ confidence level as they perform for their audience. Students and parents are excited about this wonderful opportunity and show their full support at our culminating performance. In addition, six of our third grade students were awarded dance scholarships through Ballet Tech. This year, we hosted three seasonal performances and two performances for our dance and theater residencies. These performances serve as an excellent medium for our parents, teachers and student body to watch our student performers as they showcase their talents and the skills.

P.S. 87 will join several schools across the city in an annual performance at Lehman College. Our long term partnership with Studio in a School creates a vibrant visual arts environment. 
Our dance program in K-2 is made possible through a collaboration with Music for Many and it was expanded this year to include kindergarten.  Our Equity Focus this year was around Boys of Color and we introduced an all-boys Hip Hop group in Grade 3/4. Grade 1 performance of Lion King World has become a school tradition. A teacher introduced a new club this year called, “Lights! Camera! Action! Students were introduced to the world of movies and film making.  Students performed all the roles from generating ideas, script writing, storyboarding, acting, directing and many different roles behind the camera.

This Select Chorus also participates at the Lehman College music festival.  Students in 3rd, 4th, and 5th are also apart of the recorder club.  Many students chose to join a club which meets during their recess time. These students can be apart of chorus, recorder group, or a visual arts club.  The 5th grade students also have the opportunity to participate in the percussion ensemble during club hours. The visual arts club creates inspirational posters for the school, dance festival posters for each class in the school, and decorations for school awards assemblies. All students participate in the annual dance festival. Each grade creates a choreographed dance which is performed for the school, parents, and community. In addition to the events that take place during school hours, families participate in Family Art Night. These events take place twice a year and over two hundred people have enjoyed spending time painting and creating art. ",,billiejo osowicki,art teacher,bosowicki@schools.nyc.gov

Collaboration among students, staff and parents is the foundation for supporting student learning in all areas. Our arts teachers partner with one another, as well as other teachers, in an effort help students make connections between the arts and across the curriculum. Our common goal is to escalate student participation, heighten best practices in teaching and include parents and community in our partnership for an exemplary arts education program. We also work in collaboration with available artist residency programs to expose our students to as much culture and experience in the arts as possible. This year our residency programs included Dancing Classrooms, Park Avenue Armory, and Disney Kids. This year, in preparation for our production of Aladdin Jr., parents were invited to participate with their children in set and stage prop design during parent involvement time. Each of these experiences allows students to make connections between the arts while applying depth of knowledge in core subjects, including language arts, math and social studies. Together, our teachers are working to help our students to grow creatively and intellectually, while having positive experiences for self-expression.",,Jennifer Duberman,Art Teacher,JDuberman@schools.nyc.gov

There is one Visual Arts teacher and one Music teacher that service approximately 600 students throughout the academic year.  Each class from Kindergarten through 5th grade engages in a minimum of 45 minutes per week of visual arts education and 45 minutes per week of music education.  
Second grade students have the opportunity to ""Build a Musical."" A resident from the Inside Broadway organization visits the school two times per week for 2 hours from February to May.  This program was made possible by a generous grant given by Councilman James Vacca. 
Five second grade students traveled to the Ballet Tech School in the city to participate in a 4 month program in which they learned various ballet techniques. 
Through collaboration between the P.T.A. and administrators, all grades are able to participate in assemblies that promote art culture.  For example, Kindergarten through 2nd grade students were given the opportunity to view Chinese acrobats perform and were then engaged in a question and answer session. Additionally, fifth grade students participated in weekly practice for the months of October and November to prepare for P.S.108's annual Veterans Day celebration.  Students were taught choreography and practiced singing songs related to various time periods in our nation's history. Students then performed these learned dances and songs for honored Veterans.

In the art classroom students development many forms of visual arts that they can display throughout the school; culminating in the development of an arts portfolio and end of year art exhibit. 

In the band classroom, students work on their individual musical instrument, learning the fundamentals of reading and playing music.  Students prepare in grade 8 for performing art school auditions.  All students prepare for the end of year concert.

Throughout the school year students participate in out of the classroom experiences visiting arts high schools; visiting a local college and attending one of their own musicals;  having college music students perform for them and lead instruction; visit art organizations such as Materials for the Arts; visit local art museums and exhibitions; and attend an open rehearsal of a music entity (specifically  this year the NY Philharmonic).

Students have completed two integrated theater projects and three visual arts projects. Students are offered an array of arts electives to choose from, including fashion, drama and theater, visual arts, capoeira, step, digital media, which include movie making and editing, digital graphic design and culinary arts. These electives are extracurricular, run for twenty week semesters, and students receive 120–180 minutes of the arts each week. Within the regular school day students also receive instrumental music, visual arts, and digital arts enrichment courses that run in ten week cycles.

PS57 has two full time certified arts teachers, one in music and one in visual arts. Students engage in either music, visual arts or both during the regular school day. Most classes receive two periods of music and one visual arts or two visual arts and one music class. 
  Students also attend after school classes in puppetry, dance, visual arts, circus arts, and drumming through LEAP and Marquis Studios. Children attend class trips to museums, shows and theater.
  PS 57 has both a winter and spring chorus concert. Chorus is a combined group of third to fifth grade students. Lower grades present a winter and spring musical performance with the entire class.       
  Student artwork is displayed throughout the building and in classrooms. There is a genuine pride that students feel about their artwork. Student artwork has been selected for The Bronx Arts Festival Lehman College.  
  Students benefit from attending The Victory Theater, Metropolitan Museum of Art and Lehman College Theater performances.
  PS 57 strives to do all we can with the space and budget allowed our school. Children's artistic talents are recognized and celebrated.

On a weekly basis, students are involved in Theater, Music, Visual Arts, Culinary Arts.  Students will, before the end of this year, also embark upon a 'school logo' competition. 
Our students have access to smart boards in every classroom, as well as Ipads, laptops, video equipment and art supplies which the school provides.
It is one of our goals for the upcoming school year to hire an Art teacher who can facilitate this work on a full time basis during the day with all our students. 
Another goal for the upcoming school year is to introduce to our 5th grade students the experience of theatrical performances on 'Broadway' to give them a broader perspective on theater and the art of acting before a live audience.",,Chamroeun Roeung,Teacher/Arts Survey Liaison,croeung@schools.nyc.gov

In our general music program, students learn about key moments in music history, and a basic knowledge of music theory and notation. Students also have opportunities to compose music using technology. They learn how to play the guitar in the guitar lab. Our music teacher works with 8th graders during their lunch period to help them prepare for auditions to high schools for music. We collaborate with our school-based organization, Learning through an Expanded Arts Program (LeAp), for several after school arts programs. Our music teacher runs a modern band program, including guitar, bass, drums, keyboards and vocals. This guitar ensemble has performed at district events and most school events.

Our student body currently takes  art education classes twice a week throughout all 3 years.  They have Visual Arts, Theatre and Musical Theatre, depending upon their grade. Interdisciplinary education is the bedrock of our arts program. Art's endless possibilities create differentiation that builds strong personal connections to content in other classes.  One example is how our Special Education Social Studies classes are taught in conjunction with arts education classes. When the 6th grade began a unit on early human civilization, they studied cave paintings in art.  They investigated the messages on cave walls and developed their own cave paintings making paint from vegetables, grass and dirt.  They designed one cave painting for Early Man and one for Future Man.  Each painting's message was developed from their knowledge of SS content and aligned with their RACE paragraphs about the birth of civilization. Students also performed improv as different tribes and monologues as Early Man. A student said ""It's kind of cool, it's like I'm history.""  This is a key goal at IS 190, teaching our young minds to recognize and develop their natural curiosity, imagination and innovative thought processes. Building a personal bridge to understanding is necessary for lasting comprehension. Growth of self confidence and character are also at the bedrock of our program. Establishing environments where students feel safe and respected builds life long trust and confidence.","We are a small Title 1 school that has very very limited funding for Arts Education.  We are in a growth period for arts education, yet lack the funding to give the students the experience of producing a complete musical or play with costumes, sets lights etc. We strive to enrich our students' experiences in the arts.  In a community where access to after school and weekend dance, music or art programs is limited or financially untenable, our program strives to provide students with an introduction. Not only to the concepts of art, but to recognize that everybody has an inner artist (no matter how badly they think they draw!)  With an outlet for creativity, kids who think they're ""stupid""  blossom.  Our students are often afraid to say what they think. Through art we see them gain confidence and connect to their thoughts, eventually sharing. Access to art allows them to like themselves. They learn how to communicate respectfully, listen to each other and respect differences.  Although Manhattan, with many of the finest museums and theatres in the world is only a 45 minute subway ride away, it may as well be Texas. Having funding which would make museums and theatre a regular part of their lives would open up a new world to our students. It could possibly begin a life of regular visits to NYC's fine arts venues. We're in need of funding, enough to help our students develop a more varied and deeper experience with art both inside and outside our walls.

To enhance the arts program in the coming year, students will engage in a technology course incorporating elements of fine arts and photo editing in order to support artistic expression and 21st Century skills. Students also engage in a visual arts program in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades where students have different projects every year, culminating in final projects.

Our program has expanded this year to include two full time visual art teachers offering weekly lessons in both two and three dimensional art that include drawing studies, drawing techniques and graphic design projects across all three grade levels.

All students participate in enrichment twice a week during Choice Class periods as part of our Extended Learning Time program. This year we increased art-based offerings by incorporating dance and chorus instruction at all grade levels for the entire year along with periodic dance workshops for self-selecting students. This has also created opportunity for student self-expression in culminating performing arts showcases. 

We partner monthly with assembly providers who infuse the performing arts through, music, song, dance, and rap into a social emotional message while also introducing students to art-based careers and pathways. We also have arts-based curricula that is integrated into subjects across the content areas.

In this course, the learner will learn concepts of art that focuses on learning about what it means to develop art and create art as a network of artists. Grading will be based on the following criteria:  Class work /Class projects (Product/Project-Based, Independent, collaborative)  In-class projects done individually and/or with peers if project requires it.

They then had to create a 6” square representing line, shape, color, value, texture & space.  They put those squares onto cardboard and created the 7th element of form out of them.  

Candido Bido: 6D & 7D then moved onto a project about Dominican artist Candido Bido.  They studied his portraits and style and were tasked with creating a wax resist painting inspired by his art.  Students were also tasked with identifying his work and citing evidence as to why it was a piece of his or why not.

Self Portraits: 7C & 7B looked at self portraits by famous artists throughout history.  They learned how to draw a face using a geometric based formula that they could then alter.  Once students grasped the formula, they were asked to select one of 3 stylized portrait instructions based on Paul Klee, Chuck Close & Giuseppe Arcimboldo. One students’ Paul Klee portrait was submitted to the NYSATA Legislative Exhibit for March 2018.

Surrealism Rooms: 6B & 6C learned how to create a room using 1-point perspective.  Students then learned about Salvador Dalí and the Surrealism style.  Students were then tasked with drawing in surrealist elements to their room and coloring it in with marker or pencil to have a craftsmanship of a level 4 (out of 4). One students’ piece was sent to the NYSATA Legislative Exhibit for March 2018.

This is evidenced in the pride that students express as they speak about their work in class critiques and as they offer constructive feedback to their peers. A strong focus on literacy allows students to speak to each other using the language of art as they discuss both their work and the work of others. Further, students can carry their knowledge and engage in the language of art as they move beyond the classroom walls. The vast cultural mecca that is our beloved New York City offers students a wealth of resources to enrich their arts education experiences and support personal growth beyond the scope of the classroom. Students who are identified as having a special love for the visual arts will be encouraged to seek such additional educational and career opportunities.

All students receive Visual Arts and Music instruction at least once a week from full-time, certified teachers at the school.  

In Visual Arts class, students are exposed to the work of artists to  help them see how different styles have developed over time, then have the opportunity to create their own work in those styles.  Students work in a variety of mediums, from painting to collage to pen and ink.

In music class, students learn about rhythm, scales, and harmony as they sing, dance, and play instruments.  You will see kids playing conga drums, ukuleles, recorders, or just about any other instrument you can think of when you walk into our music room!

In addition to art and music, we offer a wide variety of after school and part time programming.  In our after-school Shakespeare Rock Program, 4th and 5th grade students put on a full scale production of a Shakespeare classic (this year's group is doing Macbeth) and learn to play Bass, Guitar, Keyboard, and Drums.

Each year, it is our goal to align all of our subject areas in an effort to provide our students with seamless learning and inquiry. Our students are exposed to varied forms of art; including visual arts, theater, dance, and music. Our in-house art teachers, along with our art consultants are innovative and seek to stay current with the trends and new discoveries within their disciplines. We take much thought and pride in how we align each grade with the arts. Each of our grades is assigned an art form according to their social studies curriculum. Our artists and classroom teachers collaboratively study the units and decide what the essential question and year's focus would be for the students across each grade. We provide our students with authentic art instruction which allows them to truly understand the art form that is being studied. Our students are provided with many opportunities to engage in trips, which enhance their art awareness and make their learning real and alive. Our students are also provided with many opportunities to study the varied forms of arts, collaborate with their peers and their teachers, and then present their Type III products. They engage in varied in-house art exhibitions, as well as exhibitions outside of the school on stage, in museums, and at dance competitions. We tap into our students' talents and teach them to be confident artists.","Public School 9 is a Whole Child school that uses the five tenets of Healthy Safe Engaged Support and Challenged to govern our diverse school community.  In an effort to prepare our children for their future in the 21st century we have rebranded our school to promote STEAM. We believe that our students should be given an opportunity to be exposed to more Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics.  We believe that providing our a strong, organic curriculum that is strong in the sciences as well as the arts would help them see the world in totality. We focus heavily on social and emotional supports for our children and their families. We encourage student and family voice and promote many avenues for parental involvement. We believe in tapping into the talents of both the students and the adults in our school community.",Sandra D'Avilar,Principal,sdavila@schools.nyc.gov

Infused throughout the curriculum, the arts provide opportunities for differentiated instruction within various learning modalities. As a neighborhood school within Brooklyn's newly designated ""Tech Triangle,"" we offer an innovative STEAM program, with the arts and design front and center, informing and energizing science and math. Moving forward with an applied learning approach, the arts support and reinforce learning in the Common Core Subjects while developing skills and understandings in the individual arts disciplines. Grade-appropriate lessons are designed to enhance vocabulary and critical thinking skills necessary to prepare students for college and beyond. In addition to an experiential curriculum, students demonstrate mastery of concepts and content as well as processes. We utilize the rich cultural resources of New York City as an extension of classroom activities through trips and assemblies. Collaboration with cultural partners such as the New York Philharmonic provides opportunities for direct instruction to students as well as professional development for classroom teachers. This enhances music, dance and drama instruction.
","This is our first full year without any magnet funds to sustain our rich programming.  There has been some decline in overall 100% arts programming compliance.   We were able to shore up some programs with limited grants dedicated to in-school, during the school day, arts experiences.

Additionally we are a school with a focus on media arts, which includes film.  This is the first year of the roll our of the BluePrint for the Moving Image.  Most classroom teachers include this arts discipline producing at least one movie a year.

The program is inquiry based.  Each class lesson is based on a three-part lesson where each class begins with a demonstration (and objectives are stated), then the work time (which is the heart of the class) and a reflection where the objectives are reinforced and the kids understand and reflect what they have done.  There are concrete goals (what the children's fingers are doing, like cutting shapes) and then there are greater key ideas (animals are made up of simpler comprehensible shapes). In kindergarten, students will be able to cut and place shapes.  By 2nd grade, they should be able to arrange them meaningfully, and understand spatial relations like overlapping.  By 5th grade, they should be able to plan and execute collage designs whether abstract or figurative.  By the end of the 5 year residency  students will have been exposed to all visual art media.","The last two years our students have been excited about the residency visual arts program, however, they are still underserved in other Art disciplines such as: dance, theater, and music which would provide them with a well rounded cultural experience.

Having to have been a Nationally Certified AVID School, we continue to use strategies for students of color who also are among the 1st in their families to go to college.  This program uses specific strategies to encourage an early interventio",Michael Walker,Principal,mwalker10@schools.nyc.gov

Thanks to funding received from the VH1 Save the Music Foundation
and the Middle School Initiative Afterschool Grant, we have just completed year 4 of our new and improved Arts Education Program. VH1 Save the Music Foundation provided us with band instruments and other resources necessary to establish a music program. Every single child in the building learns to play an instrument. Students are learning to play one of the following instruments- flute, clarinet,
saxophone, trumpet, trombone, drums, violin, viola or cello. To ensure the sustainability of the program, VH1 Save the Music also provides
us with partnerships and mentorship opportunities. The supported provided by VH1 Save the Music has been tremendous and has also resulted in our chorus being featured on Gloria Estefan's original song ³America´which was apart of the soundtrack for 2015 Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks show. The funding received from the Middle School Initiative Grant was use to launch a free afterschool
program centered around the arts. Our afterschool provider is ArtsConnection. This organization has created a program designed to link learning and the arts. Over the past 4 years, they have worked on exposing our students to wide array of art disciplines- dance, music, visual arts, drama and moving images. ArtsConnection has also successfully infused opportunities for students to develop social
emotional skills around leadership, citizenship, discipline and building community.
","Over the past few years, the population of students performing at a Level 1 and Level 2 has increased drastically. As a result, we have a greater amount of students with significant academic needs. Many of our students require extended day supports in addition to traditional supports rendered during the regular school day. A large majority of our students are considered at-risk due to their academic, social, economic and/or housing status. We have a special education population of 35%

Instruction is designed to push students further to use their knowledge of materials and methods to explore experiences and ideas through art making and visually communicate to the viewer.  The art curriculum is extremely varied in terms of media and method, using pencil, charcoal, oil pastels, paint, paper, cardboard, wood, fabric, clay, and found objects. Methods such as drawing, painting, 3D construction, sculpting, collage, mosaics, and printmaking are used.

UAMA integrates visual, literary and musical arts into the academic school day. While we have full-time music and visual arts teachers, there are plenty of opportunities to allow for students to engage with the creative arts in other content specifc classrooms with arts integrated units. Students also participate in Extended Studio art classes taught by professional artists once a week in an extended school day. Students have the opportunity to connect with professional internships and undertake independent projects under the guidance of an Extended Studio Teacher and art teacher. Students share their work in class critiques and share-outs and around the school in displays. Field trips, events, and visiting artists further enrich students’ experience and allow them to consider how their academic and arts experiences can translate into careers and life-long interests. UAMA also provides enrichment and internship programs that extend beyond the school day. These take place both at UAMA (through our Extended Studio after-school program) and off-site, through our partnerships.",,Alma Encarnacion,School Business Manager LV2,Aencarnacion5@schools.nyc.gov

This will increase our ability to provide rigorous instruction that meets NYSED visual arts commencement standards 1c (demonstrate an increasing level of competence in using the elements and principles of art to create art works for public exhibition), 2c (take advantage of community opportunities and cultural institutions to learn from professional artists, look at original art, and increase their understanding of art), and 2d (understand the variety of careers related to the visual arts and the skills necessary to pursue some of them).

From k- 8 students experience an in-depth investigation in the arts. Students create art through inquiry, with a strong focus on revision and reflection. Two times a year students exhibit and perform their work in our bi-annual Art Expo; it is an event drawing hundreds of people and a chance for students to present their work publicly. We believe giving students a rigorous arts education allows students to discover their own interests, develop their voice and expand their critical thinking skills. The arts are a vital part of children’s growth, not only as learners, but as whole people. What is a Culture of Creative Confidence? • A belief in ones abilities and ideas and the abilities and ideas of those around them. • A growth mindset (rather than fixed) that allows for development, evolution, improvement and advancement. • A personal outlook that includes an understanding of the importance of creative thinking and the process that is involved. • An ability to receive and give critique without complaint or insecurity.",,John OReilly,Principal,joreill@schools.nyc.gov

Our third and fourth grade students were engaged in visual and digital art.  This partnership was with the 92nd St. Y.  Finally, students in grades two through five were involved in a guitar club which took place after school. Our arts classroom is equipped to provide visual art instruction to all classes. It is our goal to continue these programs obviously pending the funding.","We are currently functioning as a STEM school.  My vision is to have a STEAM education program for our students.

We have a full-time certified music teacher on staff and utilize the talents of various outside teaching artists to provide visual arts instruction to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade. In addition to our music program and in-school teaching artist residencies, students attend numerous off-site field trips which provide authentic arts learning experiences in all genres of the arts. Community Arts Partnerships have been steadily growing. We are particularly proud of the active role our parents, many of them artists themselves, have taken in increasing our students' exposure to the creative and performing arts. All classroom teachers have been trained in Visual Thinking Strategies and Arts instruction is aligned with New York State Arts Standards, as well as the New York City Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts.

This year, we added an additional Dance teacher to our Arts Department. Our Arts Department now consists of two Visual Arts teachers, two Dance teachers, two Music teachers, and one Theater teacher. Our Arts Department shares the principal's vision and goal that Arts education is integral to the development of the whole child, and especially important in supporting the learning of our sizable population of English Language Learners, students with special needs, and low-income students. The Arts Department uses the blueprints to guide their instruction, scaffolding to meet the needs of our ELLs, students with special needs, and Title I students. Our strong commitment to the Arts is further evident through our connections with cultural organizations. This year we had residency programs through partnerships with the Brooklyn Museum, LEAP, Making Books Sing & The Dramatists Guild Foundation. Furthermore, we've formed after-school partnerships with the Community Word Project & Brooklyn Youth Chorus. Our Arts Department also forms clubs both after and during school in areas such as film, piano, musical theater and stop-motion. In addition, we hold many arts fairs, and performances throughout the school-year to bring our arts to our parents and community. Our strong commitment to the arts supports all of our learners, helps them be well-rounded members of their community, and prepares them for both college and career.","Our school is made up of 40-50% English Language Learners, 15-20% Students with Special Needs, and over 90% students who receive free-lunch.

We entered year 2 of the Disney Musical in Schools grant which enabled us to perform Aladdin for three nights to our families and school community. We continued our collaboration with Arts Connection. Because we were recipients of the SWD/ELL grant for the 2017-2018 school year, we were able to provide visual arts, music and dance instruction to all kindergarten students with Arts Connection. Arts Connection also worked with first grade students on puppetry and second grade students on dance. Students in kindergarten, second, third and fourth grades worked with teaching artists from New Victory Theater, integrating theater into classrooms. They also attended performances there. Continuing our collaboration with Brooklyn Arts Exchange, teaching artists worked with second, third and fifth grades, incorporating dance and movement. S'Cool Sounds provided music instruction to third, fourth and fifth grades.

Students receive instruction in the arts at every grade level. From keyboard instruction to dance, students have exposure to every type of art form. Our focus continues to be various dance forms, steel pan, violin, percussions and piano instruction. Our STEM lab has now been open for a year. This has enabled our staff to enhance our visual and audio arts program. Our STEM team works diligently to connect technology to the visual arts. We have an extensive steel pan orchestra. Students in grades 3-5 pride themselves with mastering different arrangements, which can be quite complex. Our hallways come alive with music. At P.S.38 we feel the arts are essential to learning. Studying the arts gives students a window into the rich and interesting world around them, teaching them about their own history and culture, as well as that of other people. It cultivates self-expression, imagination and creativity as well as critical-thinking and problem solving skills.

The curriculum allows for instruction to develop a student's ability to express themselves, build skills and knowledge in a variety of forms and provide a sense of belonging in the school community. In addition, our after-school programs are driven by three goals developing talents, providing a broad range of enrichment experiences, and providing follow up opportunities for all students based on their strengths and interests.

We have partnerships with the Brooklyn Arts Council, where students K-2 participate in storytelling through puppetry, murals and mosaics, and African dance. The Brooklyn Youth Chorus for students 3-5 thrives on developing singers and vocal ensembles re-envisioning choral music performance through voice training and music study with performance experiences. Dancing Classrooms, who support our students to develop and cultivate essential life skills and behaviors such as respect, teamwork and discipline through the art of social dance.

Teaching and learning is aligned with New York City's Arts Education Blueprint. Lessons in music and visual arts will address the Common Core Standards; build
content knowledge; comprehend and critique artwork and musical performances; value evidence; use technology capably; come to understand other perspectives and cultures. Visual arts learning focuses on creating  art with different artist's materials, while discussing and comparing different art forms and artists. This includes  2 and 3-dimensional work.   First through fifth grade students all make trips to museums and galleries. Music learning focuses specifically on the students as producers of music, using wind instruments, acoustic guitars and percussion, with a lot of movement activities. All children achieve basic music literacy based on the pentatonic scale and solfège singing.
Grade 1 students participate in theater and learn theater skills, such as, stage presence, projecting voice and listening for cues. All arts instruction integrates teaching practices that support the Common Core State Standards.  This year Community School has provided a visual artist residency program for the kindergarten students.  A grant from the Brooklyn Borough President provided Garage Band and an animation residency.

In dance class, students learn creative movement, cultural, and traditional dance technique. They work with the elements of dance, improvising, choreographing, performing, and critiquing as their skills grow. Through their time in dance class, students learn historic and current dances from around the world and hone their ability to create their own choreographic work and be discerning audience members. Art class begins with a visual or tactile exploration for motivation or the introduction of an artist or skill technique. Students partake in a wide range of art-making processes and experiment with various media and techniques as they learn about art and artists from an historical and contemporary perspective. In music class, students experience a wide variety of musical genres, instruments, songs, and composers. They develop musical skills and concepts needed to succeed in any general music setting. Instruction draws on musical learning methods including the Orff Shulwork, Kodaly, and Dalcroze methods in order to allow students to explore their voices, strengthen ear training, and develop the confidence they need to succeed in any musical setting. Through their studies in all arts disciplines, students learn problem-solving, expression, vocabulary, social skills, self-confidence and creativity. Social studies and classroom vocabulary curricula are integrated into arts lessons to further support student learning.",,Emily Todras,Arts Liaison,etodras@schools.nyc.gov

Each winter we perform The Nutcracker in which over 100 children from K to 5th grade perform, design sets, make costumes, perform as stage and lighting technicians and design the program. The Nutcracker also has many of our special needs children performing in the show.This project has not only created a bonding with students in multiple grades and abilities, but with the teachers as well. They pitch in to help with everything, especially performance night. The arts is very helpful as a vocabulary builder for our large ESL population. We have twenty-six languages represented in our school. The arts gives children the confidence needed to tackle academic subjects, and gives beauty to their lives through the visual arts, music, drama and dance. Parents often ask ""What is the value of an arts education?"" We tell them that the arts is the only subject where the correct answer is not in the back of the book. You learn that the world is not just black and white and that your answer to an artistic solution is just as valid as everyone else. They learn about their own culture and others' through art projects.","For our students who arrive daily from foreign countries the arts might be their only success for the week. In music and art you can participate without knowledge of language.
This success will hopefully carry over into the classroom to help them feel confident to tackle other subjects.
The arts get students excited about coming to school to finish a new art project, or finish learning a new song.
The arts can make people feel good about themselves.",Pearl Lau,art educator,pearllau@aol.com

Classroom teachers value the arts and there are many opportunities throughout the week for children to do art in the classroom. Social studies is an area where art is fully integrated, so, for example, as our third grades study the rain forest they make papier mache animals, murals, and perform plays.   Our fifth graders participate in an enrichment cycle where they can choose from a variety of options, including many arts choices such as performing Shakespeare, digital photography, garage band, jewelry making, and more.  Trips are an important part of our curriculum across the grades, and in all grades children go to art museums (Brooklyn Museum of Art, MOMA, the Met, and more), other museums (NY Historical Society, Museum of Natural History) and theater and dance performances.

Currently, we have a full- time visual arts provider to deliver art lessons in school and a full-time dance teacher providing dance lessons. Students were able to showcase their arts education to teachers, families, and classmates through a combined visual and performing arts event that included an arts auction, workshops, and a dance performance. Our 1st-4th graders received Theater lessons through Center for Arts Education (CAE). CAE also provided dance residencies for PreK-2nd grade. Students also have opportunities to visit cultural organizations and arts venues on school trips to experience the arts outside of school.

They used a range of media, including mixed-media drawing/painting/collage, digital photography, and stop-motion animation to create visually and conceptually compelling works of art that fulfill aesthetic, expressive, narrative, and/or political art purposes. Students had the opportunity to engage in supplementary arts experiences through our afterschool program, which includes Dance, Music and Audi-Visual Clubs. Students participated in Animation and Film programs through BRIC arts and Reel Works residencies funded by the CASA grant. We hope to be able to offer more rigorous arts electives moving forward in a greater range of media, including graphic design, music production, and film editing.

They are exposed to a variety of dramatic activities to influence self-expression, character development, and ensemble building as they sharpen their analytical and performance skills. 8th graders music: 8th graders spend time doing analytical and comparative listening to music of various eras/genres and learn about group singing, arrangement and rehearsal technique, songwriting, piano, and music technology. After school activities include choir, rock band, and in collaboration with the drama department, a staged musical.

Our program is designed to enrich students through the visual and performance arts. The arts curriculum is directly aligned with the Common Core learning standards for visual and performance arts. Our goal for this year was to spark students’ thinking and creativity by providing a comprehensive and engaging program. Students learn a variety of techniques along with a firm foundation in the basic elements of art. They explore the important role the elements play in the creation of artwork throughout history. Students are inspired using a comprehensive range of visual works of art which reflect how the elements of line, shape, value, color, and texture work together to make art.

This past year, every student in our school has received visual arts instruction on a weekly basis, provided by our NY State certified k-12 visual art teacher, based on the NYC Blueprint for the Arts. Students explore and express themselves in all required 2-D and 3-D media. A focus on literacy during art classes means that students either discuss, read, or write about art during every lesson. Students engage in meaningful art making, analyze artwork, and assess their own creations. Student choice is an important part of the Teaching For Artistic Behavior initiative where students explore materials, work on individual and group projects, and reflect on the artistic behaviors they employ during art making during discussions and in written reflections. Interdisciplinary projects are a consistent part of arts instruction and have incorporated all other subject areas into the curriculum, including social-emotional development. In addition to our ongoing relationships with Mark DeGarmo Dance and the Met Opera Guild, who provide quality dance and music education to our students, PS 26 has also been able to offer visual and performing arts instruction in our after school. The CASA program provides music instruction in Afro Latin Jazz to our upper grade students. The Leadership Project provides dance, drama, and visual arts instruction to our grade 1 - grade 5 students.

Our Arts program is a work in progress and continues to build and grow.",,Fabayo McIntosh - Gordon,Principal,fmcintoshgordon@gmail.com

The Parkside Preparatory Academy Visual Arts Program is a Discipline Based Art Education (DBAE) Program that integrates the areas of aesthetics, art criticism, art history and art production. All visual arts students were given a rigorous standards-based training in the arts. Students in these classes studied the elements and principles of art through text, video, careers and everyday experiences in order to assist them in understanding how to look at art and the world around them in the eyes of an artist. Students participated in art critiques, which required them to pose questions and find answers. As they learned and practiced the various artistic skills and obtained new knowledge, this year prepared them for future art classes.

In addition, English language arts, math, science, social studies and the performing arts were integrated into the curriculum. Students were given the opportunity to recognize and appreciate the connections that exist among art, dance, music and theatre. 

Art students displayed their work in their year-long Student Art Gallery, an end of the year display, and created props and stage settings for the drama production. Drama students produced a play, Alice in Wonderland and the dance students put on the annual dance recital.",,Adrienne Spencer,Principal,aspence1@schools.nyc.gov

This is complemented by attendance at off-site cultural institutions (e.g. Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn College Center for the performing Arts, and others) and in-house student performances. Also, this year we were privy to secure a grant from our district elected official and NYCDOE arts department to work with an external partner to enhance the students' passion for African Dance and steel pan. Our goal is to increase opportunities for our students to be participants in and as viewers of various visual arts forms and performance venues. We also strive to incorporate the arts in our regular core content areas, particularly literacy and social studies. For the lower grades, e.g. pre-k & k, the activities are infused in their daily routines and used to enhance their learning experiences. Our teachers provide opportunities for arts related projects, as we maintain gallery type exhibits throughout the school building. This is accentuated during certain time of the year with special events such as Black History or Women's History Month. There is an emphasis on experiencing the arts at community museums and integrating it into the various units of study. At P.S. 92, we believe that the arts is an extension and essential component of a child's educational experience which enhance their learning and overall development.","The parents of most students are from the Caribbean. As a result, they are strong influence to culture of different art forms such as steel pan, soca and reggae music etc. Having a stronger arts program will certainly add value to the students' experiences.

Parents have been supportive of their children's education in the arts by attending the monthly assembly programs done on a grade level. We all look forward to our Cultural Day called PRIDE where we focus on preserving respect, Integrity,diversity and education in our community. Over the years due to budget constraints we have not been able to hire other Arts teachers to our school. If Arts is to be part of the complete package of educating students in our school for their involvement in their community and the world, then more direct funding has to be made available to make the vision a reality.

These classes operate on a rotation, to make sure student time spent in each area is equally distributed and not overly affected by the school calendar. In addition to daily classes in the arts, children come together each morning for a community circle called ""Bright Start"" that infuses music and movement and allows us to begin each day as a whole school community. This year we hosted both a Winter and Spring Arts Festival which drew in hundreds of family members for a night of performance and student artwork on display in our gymnasium, converted for the evening into a gallery. We hosted our third annual ""Putting Art on the Map,"" a visual arts and multicultural celebration.

Because of the continued support from Exploring the Arts (ETA), we were able to expand our arts program and bring in a vocal coach, a guitar coach, a percussionist and a graphic artist to work with the students. This year, we offered visual art classes to all of our students in grades 9-12. Students were exposed to a variety of art media and processes: creating 2D and 3D artworks to express ideas and feelings; developing a proficiency in terminology and techniques related to areas of art; developing the ability to understand and use the elements and principles of art and recognizing art as a means of communication. Students created numerous pieces of art, including self-portraits, which we put on display throughout the school. Our visual arts programs now include Graphic Design, Print-making, and Photoshop. In music classes, students in all grades learned to play a variety of instruments and formed a school band. This band performs at our school concerts and other activities. We also have a chorus and a music production class for students who are interested in creating beats and writing music using technology. We were finally able to get our Steel Pan Band up and running. We were also able to offer theater classes to all 10th and 11th grade classes, and hired an organization called STEM for Dance to enable us to offer an even wider variety of classes to our students.",,Nicole Schulman,Arts Education Liaison ,nschulman2@schools.nyc.gov

There are two choruses: grade four/five and middle school. The elementary music teacher incorporates movement, percussion and dance  elements as well as piano and choral techniques into the curriculum.The middle school music teacher provides a continuation of the elementary curriculum while adding guitar, bass and drum hit technical skills within several rock band ensemble settings using ""Little Kids Rock"" materials. School wide visual arts displays highlight student work. Classroom teachers also include art in their curriculum. Students have gone on trips in every grade that include the arts. Art  and music teachers collaborate with each other for shows, concerts, and exhibits.

This year our students have received instruction in African dance and visual arts. Ifetayo Cultural Arts Academy has helped our students experience elements of the arts that they may not normally experience.  

We are fortunate to have several gifted artists on staff.  Our certified music teacher is a knowledgeable educator who regularly participates in professional development to enhance her craft. While new to teaching dance in school, our dance teacher is a seasoned educator. She is currently exploring the steps needed to receive certification in dance instruction. Our dance teacher also attended professional development sessions regularly. Under their guidance, students have had the opportunity to create, practice and share their artistry at least twice this year in our annual winter and spring music and dance festivals.

In addition, we have provided arts instruction in a small after-school program that serviced 47 students.  Two of our classroom teachers collaborated with our music and dance teachers to provide instruction in the arts twice a week.  The students studied African, tap and swing dance, guitar, keyboard, vocal music, drum and steel pan.  ",,Denean Stephens-Spellman,Principal,dstephe3@schools.nyc.gov

In order to reach our academic goals, we integrate The Arts into all curriculum areas to provide an education that stimulates our students.

Students’ artwork is showcased outside of the school community through state and local art exhibits.  Also, our P.S. 108 Dance Club performs for the District–wide Celebrations.

We host parent Art workshops to increase parent involvement in their child’s educational experience. Our students' portfolios are accessible to parents online through the  Artsonia App and or the website. This allows the parents and students access to our art curriculum and their artwork.

P.S. 202 used to service students in grades Pre-Kindergarten through grade 8 however  grades Pre-Kindergarten through grade 5 remain due to truncation and development of various charter schools in the area.  Many of the parents are former students of the school and are proud to have their children attend P.S. 202.  The population of the school is primarily minority students with a vast increase of students of the Arabic ethnicity.  The teachers/paraprofessionals are of diverse cultures and majority of the staff have been employed at P.S. 202 for more than 15 years.  ,Laya Vosges,Assistant Principal,lvosges@schools.nyc.gov

Our Arts curriculum is aligned with both the Blue Prints for the Arts and the Common Core State Standards. The Visual Arts continue to be our main art program, providing engaging instruction to all students in pre-kindergarten through grade five.  This school year we were thrilled to add a Music program catering to pre-kindergarten through grade two, in order to promote music appreciation at an early age.  In addition, this year we have also established a school chorus composed of students in grades three to five. Our new Reader's Theater program in kindergarten through grade two has been a great addition, by promoting literacy through the Arts.  We continue to work closely with wonderful cultural organizations, such as Inside Broadway, The Brooklyn Public Library and Shadow Box Theater, in order to support a rich Arts curriculum and Arts appreciation within our school community.  
This school year we were proud to receive the CASA grant which provided us with a fantastic theater residency for students in grades three to five.  We were also awarded a parent engagement arts grant through Shadow Box Theater, where parents and their children learned puppetry and created beautiful puppets as part of a culminating celebration.
To supplement our students' appreciation and knowledge of the Arts, we have also incorporated a plethora of exciting field trips in all Arts genres including theater, dance, visual and film.  

","
Each school year, we strive to build upon and enhance the Arts education our students receive.  We continue to strengthen partnerships with cultural organizations, research and complete grant opportunities, and plan a multitude of exciting arts related field trips to support students exposure to and appreciation of the Arts.  We continually seek to elevate our Arts programming by recruiting teachers who can support all Arts genres and inspire our children to express themselves in a creative manner.  Our hope remains that a greater emphasis will be placed on allocating funds to support Arts programming, so our very deserving and talented children will get an opportunity to benefit from a curriculum that is truly well rounded and student centered.",Dianna LoCoco,Assistant Principal,dlococo@schools.nyc.gov

    Students were introduced to the Elements of Art and the Principles of Design.
They were made aware of careers in the arts and of how their projects tied in with some of those careers. Students learned how the Arts impacted their lives and how to perceive their environment in new way. We discussed how the  knowledge they gained in class could be beneficial to them in their other curriculums. We also discussed how even if they chose another career path that procedures in they learned such as planning, building, measuring etc. were all basic skills that would need in life.
      All projects included at least one Element of Art (usually more) and learned how the Element(s) were organized by the Principles of Design. Students learned new vocabulary words related to the art making process and art history information relevant to the particular project they were working on.
     Students worked in a variety of mediums, such as drawing, painting, printmaking, clay and sculpture. They were required to write reflections about their artworks upon completion. Students had class critiques where they learned from each other. They learned the steps of art criticism from their text Art Talk by Rosalind Ragans.
      Students learned to observe a work of art and using a chart understand how the artists had used the different principles to organize a given Element of Art.We covered all the Elements of Art and we used all the Principles of Design.

The art curriculum strives to incorporate interdisciplinary themes, art history and a wide range of studio materials and techniques. Higher level arts-based classes are offered in specialized areas such as fashion illustration, textile design, color theory, typography, photography, web design, mixed media and desktop publishing. Both studio and computer based graphic design courses are taken in sequential order. Currently, students can also fulfill the arts credit by taking music. We offer guitar, chorus, music appreciation, instrumental techniques, and keyboard/piano. Students have the chance to work collaboratively with their peers in the music room for performance ensembles. It is our hope that in the near future, students will elect to pursue careers in the arts. The art/music teachers attempt to tap into the students' creativity to strengthen their problem solving skills. Maxwell has participated in the annual SING competition for the past two years. Students have the opportunity to dance, sing, write, set design, be in the chorus, act, stage/lighting/sound crew. New in the Spring 2018 was a new elective course, dimensional art where students explore found art and problem solve as they create more intense artworks using mediums not usually utilized in the traditional classroom.  ","We offer two CTE pathways which fall under the ARTS for programming/transcripts.  Communications Media (graphic design) and Apparel Tech Engineering (Fashion Design).  Students who successfully complete these CTE pathways and, pass the three part technical assessment receive a CTE endorsed diploma at graduation.",Karen Koch,Arts Liasion/CTE Director,KKoch@schools.nyc.gov

Most of our field trips are arts-based in which our students are given the opportunity to attend all types of arts performances and events. For example, over the past three years, students have been afforded the opportunity to see operas at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. We also attend BAM frequently for a variety of different arts events throughout the year. Additionally, our full-time music teacher engages our students with all forms of music throughout the year from African drumming to pop music.  In November our ENYMSE Band- Little Kids Rock, performed for the District Office Legislative Breakfast. We also played at two Townhall Celebrations to commemorate student achievement on their standardized exams.   In addition,  Little Kids Rock also collaborated with our Sign Language class in a Holiday Show as well as our annual Black History Show—“Woke with Pride”.   To conclude the year, the ENYMSE Band with Little Kids Rock Modern Band performed at one of the most prestigious venues in Manhattan—The Bitter End.",,Nancy Dominique,Assistant Principal,nanburgan@gmail.com

Unfortunately were unable to afford a dance teacher for this school year, however we are hopeful that funding will emerge from some source so our students can experience all 4 genres of the arts during their K-8 years. Our music program is growing as we expand our program to build our band and orchestra ensembles. We have implemented a plan to build capacity and linear progression of skills. Our students performed their first concert this year and we hope to have annual events celebrating the Arts. Our 4th years partnership with Robert Shurbert Arts Center has allowed our students to participate in awesome performances. This year our students performed Beauty and the Beast and it was a smashing success. Our goal remains the same, to provide a comprehensive arts program to all our K-8 students.    ","We have been growing our elementary grades K-5 since 2013-14 school year. Next year 2018-19 we will add our 5th grades and then have a full K-8 program housed in two different buildings. Our K-2 programs are housed in our Annex which is across the street from our main building which house our grades 3-8. Because our grades are in two buildings, scheduling has been a challenge when we have had to share teachers. At this point and moving forward our K-2 will have a consistent Visual art and music program and progress to other Arts when they arrive in grades 3-8.

Our visual arts program provides students in grades K-8 a well-rounded visual arts experience that covers both art history and hands-on art projects.

The following programs are offered by our Art cluster teachers: Violin,  Music and the Brain, Recorders, Chorus, Band, Visual Arts classes and an ENL Theatre Arts program whose English as a new language students write, produce and perform original dramatic plays. Students perform at monthly PTA meetings, recorder and violin concerts. Band and chorus students also perform at annual winter and spring concerts.  At our 8th annual Cultural Festival students performed dances, music and songs from American, Arabic, Chinese, Greek, Latino and Russian cultures. Visual Arts, Band and Chorus students participate in local and city-wide contests such as: Fall Window Painting, Fall Poster, Sustainability Calendar, District 20 Visual Arts Showcase, Brooklyn Arts Festival, Music Memory Competition and the Respect for All Contest for which we were honored in 2018. At P.S. 170 we are committed to fostering a lifelong love and appreciation of the arts.        ","The school has a very diverse student population, Asian, Arabic, Latino, White, etc. There are over 20 language spoken in the school community.

Our Visual Arts Program stresses the use of multi-media techniques using a hands-on approach with successful results. The use of journals reinforce the art curriculum through writing. Our music program has presented several school-wide recitals showcasing the children's musical progress. Our music teacher focuses on understanding breath, pitch, rhythm, melody, voice, movement and incorporates this into the daily curriculum. We display our progressions and learningss through music performances and art exhibitions. We are continuing to see positive feedback from our students in terms of self-confidence and experiential learning. In addition our school continues to provide our 5th graders with a 20week Ballroom Dancing Program. We have also enjoyed a visual arts residency for our ICT classes through the Shadow Box Theater.  Imagination Creations conducted a residency in visual arts, for our 1st graders. We were very excited to have recieved a grant for a school mural. Our entire school community was free to participate in our school wide mural being painted in our school yard.  Fifth grade students generated the initial sketches for this project.

With the help of Mr. Ronald Miller, architect and director of Planning Design Construction for Maimonides Medical Center, classes use a lifelike request for proposals to design a building by preparing floor plans, elevation plans, axonometric drawings and a scale model. Ten final teams are chosen to represent the school of design Expo, a special day at the center for Architecture in Manhattan where the teams present their designs to a panel of professional architects. Our school presents an annual festival of the arts allowing students to showcase what they have learned through dramatic performances, musical concerts and exhibition of student art.

Arts teachers are given the opportunity to inquire with each other to align curricula and share best practices. All arts programs are aligned with the Blueprint for the Arts. The arts are infused in every classroom and the existence of the arts is truly evident throughout the building through the use of TV screens in the halls highlighting our monthly assemblies, monthly PTA arts shares, and artwork displayed on each floor.

New this year, we added a full time Theater Teacher beginning in January who worked with classroom teachers to create performances that were curriculum based and presented to parents. At PS 748, we incorporate the Schoolwide Enrichment Model where students get their choice of arts classes including theater, sculpting, dance, and music. In addition, students in grades 4 and 5 participate in academies where the arts are also explored. Students change their selection throughout the year to gain exposure to various disciplines. The Brooklyn School for Global Scholars also believes in building strong relationships with parents. We have an annual winter concert and dance festival each year.

All students receive instruction in the Visual Arts from either the school's licensed art teacher or the artist-in-residence. Students participate in boroughwide and citywide contests and have the opportunity to have their work publicly displayed. This year, a second grade student made it to the semi-finalist round of the PS Art competition. We also had a second grade student's artwork displayed at the Brooklyn Borough Arts Festival.Several students have had their artwork exhibited throughout the community in places such as a major department store. All students experience a vocal and instrumental music program which includes recorder, violin, keyboard and a complete Orff orchestra. These programs culminate in four concerts and various assemblies throughout the school year. Our school also participates in the Little Kids Rock music program which uses modern band instruments. We also have several arts residencies in place. We are excited to have been designated as a magnet school with a focus on Environmental Studies and Community Wellness. We will continue to incorporate the arts into other disciplines through STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, math ) and a project based learning approach. Through project based learning, we motivate our students to incorporate many aspects of the arts into their development of problem solving.This approach promotes critical thinking and vigorous learning,",,Lori Shenkman Cortazzo,Arts Liasion,Lshenkmancortazz@schools.nyc.gov

The arts allow students to expand their academic horizons through a knowledge of cultural appreciation and enlarge their understanding of the world. In our efforts to prepare our students for college and career, the arts program has also been aligned with our social studies curriculum and the Common Core State Standards. Our goals for our arts program are to allow our student population to appreciate the diverse cultural heritages inherent in our school, and to help create a respectful and tolerant learning community. We have also sought opportunities with Digital DELLTA through the Brooklyn Arts Council grant funding to bring theater to our school to service all of our English Language Learners in grades 5-7. In addition we applied for and received a CASA Grant for additional visual arts instruction through the Brooklyn Arts Council. Through this program the students have left a legacy for future students by the paintings of murals throughout our school building. We have also engaged parents in the arts by inviting them to workshops that culminated in the painting of murals that are displayed in our multi-purpose room.",,Dana Sivio,Assistant Principal,dsivio@schools.nyc.gov

The administration supports every effort to create and maintain the rich and nurturing environment for the arts to blossom. P.S. 212 offers a musical theater program for all grades that includes acting, directing, and design. Puppetry in Practice has supported our arts program by offering a residency to students in various grades. The program incorporated both visual arts and theater in the classroom setting.  We offer a Literacy through Dance program by utilizing a full time dance teacher and program theater and dance clubs for grades 2-5 before, during and after school hours. This year, we have introduced a glee, chorus and cheer club. We also hosted an after school art club which was attended by over 35 students. We have an annual Costume Parade and Dance Festival for the lower grades; a winter concert for all grade levels; a 5th grade musical theater production directed by the theater and dance teacher and complimented by the work of the art club. Our school participates in the Ezra Jack Keats Book Making Competition and our art clubs in grades grades 3, 4 and 5 submit artwork for different contests. Student art pieces are celebrated in a grade level art family fun event. This year, our student art work was selected once again for recognition in the borough arts fair and also to be displayed as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art showcase.

The arts programming consists of a full-time certified visual arts teacher, a music teacher/ drama teacher, and a dance teacher. Students in the elementary grades have an opportunity to experience dance, chorus, drama, and visual arts at least one period a week. Students in the middle school have visual arts twice a week.  

The school takes students out of the building to visit museums that are integrated with their social studies, science, and ELA curricula. This year students went to the Whitney Museum, Museum of Modern Art, Rubin Museum, Snug Harbor, The Chinese American Museum, and Brooklyn Navy Yard. In addition they took trips to see the cityscapes where they drew from observation at the Brooklyn Bridge Park and Coney Island. The school also brought in several arts partnerships this year including The Brooklyn Public Library, Museum of Modern Art, Marquis Studios, and Brooklyn Arts Council. This school received ELL partnership grant from DOE Arts. This enabled the school to have a theater program for 12 weeks with 4th and 5th graders. 
The students at PS 238 are growing artistically. This year we had four semi-finalists and one final artist in citywide PS ART show. In addition one student's work is represented in the Brooklyn Borough Arts festival. The school is looking to further strengthen the arts department by developing more arts partnerships in the music and dance disciplines as well continuing to develop the community involvement in the arts.",,Wendy Newman,Art Teacher,wnewman@schools.nyc.gov

Students in the photography program identify and research trends in photography that make them adaptable to the shifts in the professional industry. We also created a media program. Students use professional video equipment and learn how to broadcast live events. After assessing students to see who had an interest in choral music or in playing an instrument, we created two additional classes in our schedule. We now have a chorus class and a band class. Our theater program is in its fourth year. Our students will be performing a fourth musical at the end of May. This year, we had our second winter festival. Our Theater classes performed along with the band and chorus. We also created a Set Design class in the spring of last year. The students are creating, designing, building and painting the scenery for our spring musical. Our Photography program established a partnership with The Art Deco Society. Through this organization, our Photo students had the opportunity to learn and explore Art Deco designs in and around NYC. We will continue to use student portfolio assessments, sketchbooks, projects and our literacy initiative in the arts classes as a way of assessing knowledge and skills. We have attended professional development this year that addresses how to make our instruction more aligned. We will continue to build on what we have established and hopefully add more productive programs as we move forward.","Currently we have one screened program for the Arts which is Photography.
We have built a Music, Theater and Arts program in house.  We survey students in the 9th grade to see if they are interested in joining either the Theater, Music (Band or Chorus) or Visual Arts classes and this is how we have been building our program.

Film and music literacy are woven through core classes through introducing students to various tools to cultivate, unlock, and express their creativity in multiple modalities. By tapping into their artistic voices, students apply critical thinking skills via projects and peer review and critiques of works in progress. The school maintains a student photography gallery of nearly 50 framed works to evidence concepts learned while emphasizing ownership as well. In support of our arts program, while making connections to art and artists studied in class, we continue to partner with and immerse students in the visual arts through visits to the Whitney Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, The International Center of Photography, Brooklyn Museum, and more. Students are taken on photography and film trips to capture and create work at Central Park, Prospect Park, and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.  Students participate in Teen Nights at the Whitney Museum & the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

This year P.S 109 provided the students with instruction in painting, drawing, pastel art, mixed-media and sculpture. Cross-curricula information was incorporated into each visual art lesson, and each unit plan was tied to a specific artist and art period. Art Club was offered every day during lunch in order to facilitate the students with high school portfolio preparation, and the development of personal art interest exploration. As a result four students were accepted into the specialized art high school programs of their choice. Students were provided with differentiated visual and physical materials in order to reach their diverse learning styles. Students work was exhibited in the Annual District 22 Art Show. Additionally, students displayed their work in the Annual Brooklyn MLK Arts Competition.  Students entered their work into State Senator Kevin Parker's Annual Earth Day Arts contest and the winning Art work is displayed on the Senator's web page. P.S 109 is currently working with an art partnership called Studio in a School; students are exploring pottery making and clay sculpture design from a teaching artist.

PS 119 is committed to developing the whole child with a focus on the arts. Students are given art and music instruction from pre-k through grade 5. A magnet school, each year students study diverse cultures with a culminating expo demonstrating student learning and achievement. An important part of the school culture is to expose our children to global traditions while promoting peace on earth. Art is seen as a tool for creative expression as well as a pathway for language development and behavior modification. Our arts partners work in concert with the arts educators and classroom teachers to provide the most coherent scaffolding of lessons for making meaning through the arts. Students visit cultural institutions and performances throughout the school year. It is through this far-reaching arts approach that we believe children are motivated to enjoy learning across the curricula as they evolve into their best selves.  

Additionally, our school has a strong foundation of Peace Education that defines the culture of the building.  PS 119, has been recognized by the United Nations for its effort to Promote Peace through Arts Learning.  Our goals are to broaden the resources available to our students, teachers and families in the classrooms and in the arts spaces.

In addition, we embrace the Arts Blueprint and arts standards based units of study/lessons which connect the arts to the Common Core subjects. As a former i3 Arts Achieve school, we focus on formative and summative assessment which works to empower students to reflect and directly enhance their art. This process makes experience and performance in the arts more valuable by connecting them to a multitude of resources. Therefore, we believe there to be a significant correlation of arts achievement on improved English Language Arts performance. Additionally, we are furthering our school's curriculum by integrating a S.T.E.A.M approach to teaching across all grade levels. It is our firm belief that this holistic approach to learning will yield students to become well-rounded, with the ability to incorporate the arts seamlessly into their daily lives. In this we foster students to make educated, college and career choices which is rooted in the education they receive at PS 207.","The Fillmore Academy features a very strong visual art and musical arts program. The visual arts program offers a screened Portfolio Development/Advanced Art Skill class. Students create portfolios which enable them to audition for specialized high schools. Our school holds an annual gallery exhibit and we are also a former i3 Arts Achieve school in the Visual Arts. Our music program, a former Juilliard Grant school, offers students a screened instrumental ensemble which includes a specialized Jazz Band. Our music program also offers chorus for both upper elementary and middle school students. Both the choral and band groups present two shows yearly. Furthermore, our music and visual arts programs take part in multiple contests, as well as the District 22 band and visual arts show. Through our after-school program Millennium, we have an elementary and middle school theater program which puts on one to two shows each year.

PS 217's goal is to provide all students with sequential instruction in the arts so they meet benchmarks in the arts blueprints. Students experience instruction in visual arts, music/movement and theater/dance. They receive additional instruction through residencies and our extensive after-school program which offers 14 arts related clubs providing 44 additional hours of arts instruction to 257 K-5 students.  Fourth and fifth graders choose an area in the arts they wish to focus on and experience in-depth instruction in our Discovery Zone Program by participating in one of twenty-four different clubs. Instruction takes place during an extended last period on Fridays, adding thirty hours of arts instruction for these students

Our Art Team collaborates with classroom teachers integrate the arts into all subjects. 
 
Our students participate in visual arts activities such as painting, drawing, collage, and sculpture. Students learn about famous artists through read aloud, research and class discussions. Classroom teachers creatively connect drama and literacy by designing lessons where the children act out stories and put on plays. In addition, students engage in activities such as performing dance routines and drama skits for the students and parents of P.S. 222 to enjoy. Music and expressive movement are integrated into various curricula areas throughout the day. 

Teachers work collaboratively to produce grade level performances such as songfests and holiday shows. We support our students’ talents and creativity by encouraging them to participate in a variety of contests. Every year our students participate in competitions where they can design books, posters, or create songs for the particular topic of the competition.

Parent workshops specializing in continued Arts learning at home. 3. Develop student awareness of artistic options through the strategic use of technology and digital media. 4. Professional Development seminars for staff to support use of technology and the arts in student learning and engagement.
This school year we have worked to enhance our arts programs by incorporating and utilizing technology to enrich and assist creative learning and exploration.  Through collaboration of the technology and arts teachers, students are able to create digital portfolios via Google suites programs.  Our goals for creative technology use is to help increase family and community participation in the arts, cultivate rigorous and meaningful arts experiences while fostering college and career readiness.

We have also been awarded a Cultural After School Adventures Grant through our local councilman. Through this grant, permanent artwork will be displayed for all to enjoy. Our Art Exposition is our culminating event and takes place in the middle of June for students, staff, and parents. Students in our Chorus, Pre-K, and Kindergarten classes have performed several Holiday shows for our student body and parents alike. All classroom teachers have participated in the Nalini Kids program, which encourages nurturing the whole child, including physical, emotional, and character development. We also enjoy The Shubert theater grant through ArtsConnection. Six third grade students participated in Ballet Tech's beginners program.
We have had Miss USA visit our school and co-teach with several students. Our STEAM team has secured the NASA Education Downlink which promotes Education in Space. Our students will interact live with astronauts on June 21, 2018.      ",,John Norton,Principal,jnorton@schools.nyc.gov

We recognize the importance of the positive impact of the Arts on the healthy development of students, both intellectually and socially. Integration of arts education can effectively engage students in all areas of study, helping to raise student achievement, as well as develop students' creative abilities to foster aesthetic appreciation.

Through various arts residencies made possible by Arts Matters funding, all students also received exposure to cross-curricular arts instruction. Symphony Space conducted a 6 week residency in which students learned about traditional music from Africa, South and Central America and Asia, which overlapped with their units in Social Studies.

artists and how the life of an artist affects his or her artwork.
Students very often create an original version of the work of a famous artist.( example- ""Starry Night"" by Vincent Van Gogh)
Students experiment with different kinds of media to create original artwork.a
  Oil pastels, markers,  colored pencils, tempera paints,
and water color paints are used.  Students have the opportunity to
engage in lessons with different art techniques.  The art techniques covered are: drawing, painting, collage, printmaking
covered are: drawing, painting, collage, and sculpture.
Art is used as a means to build the self esteem of students.  Students are praised for their artistic efforts.  The art is displayed for others to critique in a positive way.
  For the 2018-2019 school year, I plan to concentrate on more sketching lessons.  Students will need sketch pads and easels to carry out this plan.  Trips to art museums would enhance our program.   ",,Shonelle Hall,Principal,shall26@schools.nyc.gov

Students are able to prepare for auditions and portfolio presentations for specialized high school admissions. Students are taught music, dance, and visual art as part of the school curriculum. Instrumental, choral music, dance and art are taught in morning, and after-school programs. Students may learn ballet, tap, Hip Hop, jazz, Step, African, Indian Folk Dancing, and creative movement as part of their class curriculum or as an enrichment program. Our music program consists of morning and afternoon small group instrumental lessons and pull-out multi-grade enrichment including: drum kit, woodwind, guitar, keyboard, brass and rock band ensemble. Our visual arts curriculum includes mask-making, watercolor painting, clay projects, paper-mache, and bookmaking. Our after-school program helps students explore stage decoration, portfolio preparation, and develops individual strengths and creativity. Our school has collaborative performances showcasing student achievement.We continually help our students explore new avenues of creativity through grants and special activities .",,Linda Sedda,Art Liaison,Lsedda@schools.nyc.gov

They also help the students create a play-script around the African culture.  They learn African words or adages; they learn different African dances and hear African stories.   As a culminating activity, students present a play and dance performance for the community and parents to enjoy. Another example of the Arts program is displayed in second grade.  The second-grade students learn about several artists and their paintings. After learning about art history and the different genres, the students are encouraged to create their own paintings.  These paintings are exhibited as a culminating event, where parents and the community can come and participate.  Furthermore, the third graders learn about the Latin culture.  Upon learning about different dances and the cultural history of the dances, the students study the Flamenco dance.  They present a performance for the community displaying what they have learned about this culture.

Our students are provided a well-rounded education that includes a balance of academics and arts both during the day and afterschool. We continue to provide the same emphasis on Arts as we did last year through our residencies for Ceramics and Poetry Writing with resident artists. This year, we provided theater classes twice a week to all 7th graders. Additionally, our 7th graders are working with a theater consultant to hone their skills, this will culminate in a trip to see a Broadway show.  Likewise, as part of a theater partnership, our students have seen well over 10 theater productions on Broadway this year.  Our Visual Arts teacher provided ceramics classes to 6th graders which integrates the Social Studies curriculum on Ancient Civilizations. Students at I.S. 392 this year had the opportunity to audition for a role in our Broadway Jr. production of ""Lion King"". This is the third year with this program, and our students and staff have been working hard to create a production that will be attended by other various schools, as well as our superintendent and elected officials. Broadway Jr. has allowed our students to sharpen their skills in vocal music and dance over the past three years.  In addition, art students have worked diligently to create the sets for the theatrical productions.  To incorporate art forms of diverse cultural groups, we have added steel pan, stilt walking and costume design in our art offerings.",,Ingrid Joseph,Principal,ijoseph2@schools.nyc.gov

We also provided the opportunity for scholars to participate in Ballet Tech during the school day during the winter months. Five scholars were selected each year for the past two years. 

We offer a variety of after school arts programming, through grant funding. This year we offered after school dance to K-1 and violin to 2-3 with our partners at Third Street, and martial arts for K-3 with our partners at CARE LLC. We also offered scholarships to 5 scholars in 3-4 grades to participate in dance at Dwana Smallwood Performing Arts Studio. We hope to continue and expand after school offerings over the coming years. 

Additionally, Brooklyn Landmark hosts special events that  teaching staff and student leaders facilitate, such as the Fashion & Talent Show, the Lip Sync Battle, and performances by the step team.

Arts education and engagement are embedded into our school’s curriculum throughout every grade and content area. All teachers are encouraged to expand their students’ imaginations by experiencing the excitement of class trips. Our school’s art teacher enhances our social studies and science curriculum by offering our students the opportunity to view the world from different perspectives. Students across fourth and fifth grades participate in our school’s band and our fifth graders learn the importance of working together as a team while singing in our school’s chorus. All of our third graders learn how to play the recorder. At P.S. 12Q, we are committed to celebrating our diverse student population through the arts.

Students are engaged throughout the year in various classes.  For example, our Kindergarten-Grade 2 students were involved with a puppetry and theater residency with the ARTS Connection cultural organization throughout the year and our 4th and 5th grade students were involved with a DELLTA Arts theater residency designed to increase oral language development for English Language Learners.  These residencies included studying video artifacts in practitioner groups and included a mix of planning and video documentation meetings as well as time to prepare and share the puppetry literacy strategies. Our 4th grade students were involved with the American Ballet Theater in the Nutcracker Project and were taught dance by the teaching artist as well as attended the performance of The Nutcracker at Lincoln Center.  Our fifth grade students were involved with the TADA! Theater Alliance and learned various techniques in musical theater as well as performed in front of their parents and peers.  Our school regularly hosts Art Exhibits showcasing the variety of artwork our students create throughout the year and our theater teacher directs the students in plays and skits throughout the year. PS13Q students performed The Wizard of Oz this year. We also partnered with Inside Broadway and professional Broadway performers came to our school to perform on stage in our auditorium.  Our 4th and 5th grade students were able to see the performance.  ",,Foteyne Mouzakitis,Assistant Principal ,Fmouzakitis@schools.nyc.gov

Our chorus performs annually at the Corona Tree Lighting Ceremony, at Queens Museum art openings, and at our leadership events. In April 2018, our students performed at Carnegie Hall!  Second graders show their work at Queens Museum, as do the CASA students in grades three, four and five. Additionally, all 1,782 students show at least one piece of visual art at our May Leadership Event when our school is transformed into an art gallery. We started our theater program three years ago, and our students were being celebrated at the Queens Borough Arts Fair for two years and counting. Our purpose for bringing in theater classes was to support all students, with a focus on Special Education and ELL students, in engaging in purposeful conversational English. The program has grown far beyond our expectations as our very talented theater teachers are bringing out the best in our very talented students. In the fall of 2017, we brought in a Flamenco residency to begin to build out the fourth pillar of our arts program.

Puppetry in Practice provides students with an art/theatre experience. Pre-kindergarten and Kindergarten students create puppets that come alive to tell a story. First grade students learn how to turn an ordinary marble notebook into an animated journal. Second grade students participate in a stop motion animation residency to explore science or social studies themes. First Grade students participate in a residency with an artist from the Queens Museum to explore the Tiffany exhibit, showing students a connection between the past and present. In addition to a full visual arts program, which includes an annual art show, our students work has been showcased at the Metropolitan Museum  of Art, Queens Museum and Queens Borough Arts Festival.

Our belief is that arts education enhances the intellectual and emotional lives of children by stimulating their imagination, improving communication skills, including analysis and critical thinking and strengthening visual literacy. It promotes emotional intelligence and builds character; encouraging multicultural awareness and acceptance. It instills self-discipline, inspires respect for craftsmanship and gives families an opportunity to share, explore, and celebrate ideas and feelings that children may not be able to put into words. In 2016, our teachers began implementing our Arts Elements Curriculum allowing sixth grade students to circulate through each of the available arts disciplines including visual arts, music, dance and drama. Students received instruction in each course for one semester. We placed seventh and eighth grade students in a class aligned to their area of interest as determined by the Student Arts Survey, enabling them to continue to pursue their area of interest for seventh and eighth grade arts instruction. We believe that our interest-based arts program will inspire students and allow them to creatively express their ideas, leading to increased student performance and achievement.",,Christine Tamburino,Assistant Principal,ctamburino@schools.nyc.gov

We created displays and had a school wide celebration for Lunar New Year, including a parade with a student made giant dragon leading the way.

Through the program, experienced teaching-artists collaborate with our classroom teachers to develop and facilitate art projects integrated with the school curriculum. During the twenty week in-school residencies, participating students examine, discuss, and create works of art. Students participate in three visits to the Guggenheim Museum throughout the course of the residency. Through these visits students are immersed in an environment rich with the works of master artists, where they engage in art inquiry, develop new insights into art and think critically about art and ideas. Public School 88 was also awarded a Disney Grant allowing us to partner with Disney artists in working towards putting on a spring production of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". Students will perform the production in the school for students and family members.

Through sensitive adult guidance, children are aided in mastering pivotal moves in the artistic process, the creation of ideas for personal expression, the discovery of visual qualities to express ideas and feelings, and the use of media to convey an expressive intent. A strong sense of pride is created in our students through our continued concentration on the cultural diversity of our student population. Through the varied art mediums, students are taught about different cultures by learning native songs and dances as well as art history.",,Tammy Tucker,Assistant Principal ,Ttucker4@schools.nyc.gov

Our staff includes a certified theatre teacher and two certified visual arts teachers.

We have partnerships with Repertorio Espanol, Theatre Development Fund, Flamenco Vivo and Urban Arts which bring in artists to offer classes in Flamenco Guitar, Flamenco Dance and Poetry, African Drumming, Cartooning, DJ technology, Theatre, Dance, and Web Design.

This year, students wrote and produced an original, politically charged, play that was performed at city hall. 
 
Our students' artwork was featured in both the PS Art Show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Queens Borough Visual Arts and Theatre Showcase.
We inaugurated our first annual PAIHS Visual and Performing Showcase this May. 
In addition to our International's Night festival, which featured musical and dance performances by our students.
Our after school offerings include Open Studio hours and Portfolio Club.
PAIHS has a renewed commitment to expanding its art offerings. We hope to have two digital photography sections next year as well as an AP 2D art program to culminate the PAIHS art track for students interested in pursuing art in college or their future careers, or in preparing a portfolio supplement for college. 
We hope to secure funding to maintain and further our arts and technology related electives and technologies
","Our school is a small high school located on a single floor in a four story building that is shared by three other schools. We serve an entirely ENL population of students who have recently emigrated from Spanish speaking countries. Due to limited space, art takes place in general education classrooms, though one room has been designated an art room and all materials are stored there in. We have three glass showcases for permanent art exhibition.

Our arts department leader also facilitates an Arts Monday PD for Queens North.

We were previously a Renewel school but achieved Rise status this academic year. Maintaining our arts program is essential because we believe the arts offer future opportunities for our students and support their literacy skills and affect towards school, in turn, affecting regents scores and graduation rates.

We are developing an arts track where all students in 9 and 10 take studio art and theatre and can continue through the arts track to take more advanced courses in their later grades. ",Rachel Cabrera,Visual Arts Teacher and Department Leader,rcabrera@panamericanihs.org

As our school’s enrollment expands, our Arts programs have kept pace by added new arts teachers and offering new classes to our talent program including classes in ballet, jazz dance and theatre. This year, we continued our sequential arts program in which students are allowed to take an arts sequence, focusing on content that both interests the student and promotes personal student mastery. Our goal is to promote the importance of the arts in the well-rounded students’ pedagogy. The positive life-skills acquired in such courses can be used across the curriculum and outside of the school setting. The results of this sequential programming is evident in our student’s work. Students from the Corona Arts and Sciences Academy have been selected to have their art work displayed at the Queens Museum of Art this year and our 7th grade band received a “Gold” rating at this year’s NYSSMA Major Organizations Festival. 

Our new facility is equipped with two visual arts studio spaces, a band room, a fully functioning dance space, and a multi-purpose Gymatorium with a curtained stage, lighting, and sound system. We have continued to work to expand upon our inaugural curriculum, fostering student voice and creativity through the implementation of lessons geared around arts history, theory, and practice.

All students at Maspeth High School are encouraged to enroll in a single art discipline over the course of their four year high school career. As freshmen, students choose from the following: theater, ballet, string orchestra, chorus, or visual art. Our arts courses are designed to promote the school's mission to have our students become leaders in all fields of personal endeavors through academia and to be physically, emotionally and intellectually healthy with determination and compassion. We accomplish this through a curriculum which is built upon Common Core and Blueprint for the Arts standards combined with our school's classical values. 

In addition to our daily programs, we offer multiple after-school opportunities for students to become further involved in their chosen art form, or to explore the other disciplines. Students may participate in any of the following after school clubs: Art Club (visual), Argonotes (acapella), Tech Club (theater), Band Club (all instruments), Dance Company (ballet), National Art Honor Society, String Orchestra, and Tri-M Music Honor Society.

We believe that these offerings will help us to achieve our ultimate goal of providing a foundation from which our students will develop a lifelong commitment to the arts.

This seven day cycle allows for the over 800 students to engage in the arts regularly. We also provide after school arts enrichment programs. This year we have had the opportunity to bring in many performances for our students and assembly programs that have allowed the students to interact with the artists. We also work with a cultural organization within our community to provide our students with dance. The students in our school perform in a fall and spring music and dance concert. We have also received a grant titled Disney Musicals in the Schools, which enables a school team of staff and students to learn more about musical theater. There is also an end of the year theatrical performance by the drama club. Our third grade students participated in a digital storytelling residency to help connect both media and literacy. All classes are encouraged to organize class trips to the many cultural organizations the city has to offer as additional enrichment in the arts.

Our teachers will include working with various media and techniques in the visual arts: Reader's Theater, storytelling and oral presentations, singing through the grades, and creative movement and rhythm for early childhood. Class trips to museums, concerts and theater presentations will be conducted to extend the partnerships with cultural organizations providing our students the opportunities for scaffold learning from dynamic teaching artists in music and singing. In addition, we are the recipient of a CASA grant so that our second and third grade students participate in music activities after-school. We also partner with Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and ESTA for instruction in music, dance and theater. Early exposure and integration of the arts into our curriculum expands our youngest learners' knowledge and enables our children to become more successful in the future.",,Margaret Conlon,Teacher,MConlon5@schools.nyc.gov

Teachers focused on journaling, notebooks, and portfolios.  Arts teachers collaborated in a culminating arts extravaganza. Each child in grades two through five put on a production that integrates theatre, music, dance and art. In collaboration with the parent teacher association, every third grade student received their own recorder and put on a concert for their families. All fourth and fifth grade students have the opportunity to try out for our Public School 29 Chorus, Drama Club, and Dance Company, who perform in different capacities throughout the year. The Dance Company was selected this year to perform Queens Borough Arts Festival at Queens College.Parents are invited into the building for workshops around the arts, to assist in creating scenery for productions and to participate in performances. To further extend our in-school arts program we have welcomed, Poppenhusen and Ballet Tech to work with our students. The fourth grade classes had the opportunity to see ""The Blue Man Group"" on Broadway.

We added dance to our cluster programs this year, to have the students experience varying styles that identifies the uniqueness of each one. Through our arts education residencies the students are making connections between visual art concepts and other curriculum areas. The Indian Dance residency taught the students the traditions and culture of South Asia. Through our residency, Luann Adams Story Telling, our students were exposed to folktales and fables through a theatrical approach. Inside Broadway allowed the students to feel the background experience of preparing for a Broadway play. Each of these residencies also included performances that families attended to reinforce the love of the arts at home.

This year we continued our Dancing Classrooms Ballroom residency for our fifth grade students and they loved learning how to rhumba, tango, swing dance and more! Grades kindergarten through four students reaped the benefits of a City Center Artist in Residency dance program. Students learned about the basics of movement and space and were given the opportunity to work together to create their own dances. This year, the theme was Dance through the Decades. Each grade learned all about dance in a specific decade. All students in grades kindergarten through five also received weekly visual arts instruction aligned with the Blueprint for the Arts. Projects are designed to build on student interests and skill level. All of our students are provided with opportunities to share their artistic pieces with the community on a regular basis. This year we were also able to hire a part time music teacher for part of the year to give our students exposure to music instruction. We believe that the academic performance and overall success of our students is enhanced by the presence of the arts. The dance, music, and art instruction is tied to content area learning, thus reinforcing academic knowledge. It enhances both fine and gross motor skills and coordination. It also builds a sense of confidence and provides students with knowledge specific to the art forms.","As a small, non-title I school, we struggle to pay for arts programming.

Within the arts program, students receive direct instruction in visual arts, choral music, and theater, including musical theater. We have begun to lay groundwork for a graphic arts pathway with the introduction of Stop Motion Animation and video editing.  This has been greatly aided by the addition of instructional technology hardware and software made possible through a Reso A Grant.

Students are also exposed to instruction in the arts through residencies provided by local cultural organizations. Our goal is to continue the comprehensive art program allowing students to further develop their skills in visual arts, vocal music, and in theater based projects, including musical theater.

Partner arts organizations include: Ballroom Basix, Together in Dance, Marquis Studios, and Studio in a School. We believe that it is possible, and essential, to provide arts education in creative ways. Residencies may not be traditional arts classes, but they can be equally valuable.

We have both a grade 4 and grade 5 chorus and a school band who meet with the music teacher weekly. Students in grade 3 learn about & perform on Djembe drums & other orchestral percussion. Grades four and five learn how to play and perform with recorders, guitars ukuleles, keyboard & other instruments. For a seventh year we have our CCAST (Cadwallader Colden After School Theater) program which enables us to perform an annual musical theater production. This year we performed ""Aladdin Kids."" Approximately 80 students (performers, art/set design and stage crew) were provided with a twenty week after-school program. This full scale production was presented to family, friends and the community in the spring. This performance assists us in sustaining the CCAST program for the following year. Thirty of our grade two students participated in a CASA grant sponsored by our Councilman's office. The students met for twenty 2.5 hour sessions with a resident from Flushing Town Hall to learn Chinese dance. The program culminates with a performance in June.

Our strong and ongoing partnership with musical theater teaching artist, Alastair King, provides students and staff with the opportunity to develop as musical theater artists and performers culminating in musical theatre productions on each grade level. Our partnership with Studio-In-A-School provides rich opportunities for students and staff to work with teaching artists to create and display in the visual arts, culminating in grade level art shows for families. We have partnered with Together in Dance to provide our students with creative movement and musical theater opportunities in which they can collaborate in the dance making process and express themselves through the arts. Our collaboration with Cultural After School Adventures (CASA) provides enrichment through a grant funded after school arts program for our first and second grade students which culminates in an exhibition of student artwork at The Latimer House Museum.

Three of our arts teachers were facilitators this year during Arts Monday professional development, and three of our other arts teachers participated in these professional development opportunities.

Kindergarten through third grade students learn stage presence and performance as part of music class and participate in an annual spring concert. A chorus, selected by audition, rehearses weekly and performs a culminating concert in the spring. In addition, our fourth and fifth grades were introduced to ballroom dancing this year. PTA funding supplements our arts programming which includes theater performances, Midori workshops & concerts, and a visual arts residency. A CASA grant has allowed for a partnership with Midori & Friends with after school programming in drumming and vocal training, leading to a Spring  performance. Public School 98 also offers an after school program that includes instruction in visual art, theater and music for students interested in going beyond what is offered during the school day. A school-wide vocabulary enrichment initiative has been enhanced by original songs written to incorporate themed ""words of the month"", which are performed at an annual Vocabulary Day Celebration.

This year, we expanded our commitment to linking the arts and scholarship by establishing a new local chapter of the National Tri-M Music Honor Society with our first cohort of inductees; this was also our first year performing in the NYSSMA Spring Festivals (where we were awarded Silver [Level 2]). Through a NYC ArtsContinuum grant we became a NY City Center partner school and received a Resident Artist to expand our arts offerings to include Dance for some of our 6th graders, provide them with the opportunity to attend a professional arts event (Broadway's ""Hey Look Me Over""), and to perform in two in-school dance events; the costumes for which were a product of a Costume Creation workshop series that we established to include our families and interested community members in our flourishing arts program. ","MS172 will soon be applying for a one year extension for the NYC Office of the Arts ArtsContinuum grant and intend on working with the arts vendor, NYC City Center, to once again offer dance to 6th graders (particularly from our elementary feeder school partner PS191) and working with our full time teachers of other arts disciplines to incorporate Dance/Movement elements into their curricula for other grades. Similarly, we are hopeful that MS172 will once again be recipients of a Project BOOST grant that we will use to restart the Family Engagement workshop series next year.

We have a long standing partnership with the Jewish Museum made possible through CASA and our local Congressman. We also have partnered with Arts Matters in order to provide a robust curriculum of arts instruction for all our students across kindergarten through eighth grade. In our effort to expand programming and highlight the arts by creating new experiences, our students have bridged learning across grades and disciplines and created workshops and presentations for the community. We utilized digital portfolios in the arts and piloted digital assessment software to incorporate 21st century technology for college and career readiness. We have received multiple grants made possible through arts teacher initiatives to continue to support the need to update our studio spaces. Our graduating students have gained acceptance into specialized high schools such as La Guardia, Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, Queens High School for the Sciences at York College and Townsend Harris.  As we move into the 2018-2019 school year we are anticipating to replace our music program with theater and continue to offer music through our partnership with the 92nd Street Y.",Our school services children in grades PK-8th grade.,Jessica Cruz,Principal ,jcruz42@schools.nyc.gov

Every Wednesday, for approximately two hours, our students participate in one of the following performing arts programs: Drumline, Martial Arts, Dance, Step, Visual Arts, Music, Photography, and Steel Pan. One of our most esteemed programs, Life Changing Music, allows students to explore their creativity through songwriting as well as music and video production. As featured on Fox 5 News ""Influential New Yorkers"" segment, we take pride in our students and staff having produced several CD's and music videos, including ""SWAGGER,"" ""53-Swag,"" and ""Motivate"" featuring Dres of Black Sheep. The LCM program has dramatically increased self esteem and collaboration among students as they express themselves through positive musical messages. Additionally, our Urban Arts partnership offers rigorous residency programs in a wide range of art forms, taught by expert teaching artists. All programs use a project based approach for students to develop pre-professional skills and key vocabulary while producing high quality, original artworks.

We ensure that all 950 plus students participate in dance, music, theater and visual arts classes during their years at Public School 62. Innovation is integrated across all disciplines and classroom Maker Spaces incorporate concepts with design. Fourth grade students participated in Dancing classrooms and competed in a ballroom competition.  In these classes they are exposed to a wide variety of arts across a variety of genres and cultures. Our dancers practice creative movements, develop motor skills, focus on specific styles of dance and explore a variety of ways to create and manipulate their own movement. Our arts programs provide opportunities for students to become literate in art, make social, cultural and historical connections, and become lifelong learners and advocates for the arts. Additionally, our third, fourth and fifth grades are given the opportunity to participate in an arts club (dance, visual arts, chorus or theater). This year we were awarded a Midori grant in which thirty six students were instructed in guitar.

During the 2017-18 school year, we also added Disney Musicals in Schools and the Rubin Museum of Art to our list of arts partners, with a production of “Lion King Kids” and a “Math and Mandalas” residency.  Our current performance groups include chorus, modern band, concert band and violin. Despite being a large school, PS63 ensures that every student has an opportunity to shine onstage with a show by each grade involving every student in K-5.  We feature original artwork by students in our school productions, as well as in outside exhibitions whenever possible. This year we had winners in the following art exhibitions and contests: NYSATA Legislative (exhibited in Albany, N.Y.), Public School Art (exhibited at The Metropolitan Museum of Art), Queens Arts Festival at The Queens Museum of Art, and Ezra Jack Keats bookmaking contest Queens borough winners.  This was also year two of a grant for a music/theater residency to support our English Language Learners. Our music and visual arts departments have been reliably strong, so we continue to seek ways to increase access to programs involving the theater arts and dance. In order to support the school’s 2018-2019 Social Emotional Action Plan and CEP, next year we will seek to incorporate arts activities into our Harmony program for social-emotional wellness and awareness.",,Diane Marino,Principal,dmarino@schools.nyc.gov

This is a 3 year grant which begins with strongest support in the first year and tapers off with each subsequent year. With their guidance and professional direction, we were able to prepare the students for 4 performances of The Jungle Book.  This afforded students who never sang or danced the opportunity to learn how a performance is produced. It has been extremely gratifying to watch students blossom into their roles.  We provided community outreach opportunities for parents to help with sets and costume decoration.  The students will see the Broadway show Aladdin, compliments of Disney and perform at the Amsterdam theater for their parents as a reward for participating in the Disney Musicals in schools program.
  Our school also was given the opportunity to be in a choral program which will perform at the Apollo Theater. A trained vocal teacher auditioned 3,4,and 5th graders and has been teaching them various musical pieces for the performance.

We use an interdisciplinary approach to infuse the four major arts disciplines. Visual art, drama, dance and music have been incorporated into our units of studies. Our visual arts curriculum focuses on various art forms aligned with the Blueprint for the Arts. Students study various composers and our diverse population has afforded us the opportunity to study several cultural dances during our annual dance festival. For the past three years, funding from a private donor has made it possible to secure a residency with Studio In A School. The program provides comprehensive, rich, sequential visual art instruction to all K-5 students. Each grade receives weekly art instruction in a range of media, designed specifically for PS 96Q, in alignment with the New York City Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Visual Arts and Common Core. Classes are instructed in collaboration with the classroom teachers and a professional studio visual artist. The program equips students with multiple opportunities to develop the ability to work from observation, memory, and the imagination, to plan, reflect, revise, and to collaborate, to develop ideas from multiple sources and synthesize their ideas to create original works of art that are personally relevant.

Grades 3rd through 5th work towards benchmark 5 by taking part in art critiques providing a journal response followed by a class discussion of ideas assisting students in making cultural and historical connections.  In addition, students in grades 3 through 5 practice drawing techniques to improve skill level and exercise their imagination.  Students at all grade levels are exposed to artists from the past and the present inspiring them to discover the many career possibilities in the arts.

Formative assessment is utilized in the arts classroom to support students and improve performance. Middle school students applying to screened visual arts programs in high schools will participate in a portfolio class to prepare for auditions. Public School/Middle School 124 will continue to enter art competitions such as the Queens Borough Arts Festival, the Ezra Keats Bookmaking Contest, and PS Art. In the graphic arts, students are encouraged to develop an interest in the field of graphic design. They develop their digital manipulation skills by creating a complex piece of artwork using Adobe Photoshop Elements. The program enables students to create, edit, organize, and share images with the use of a computer. In addition, the dance/creative movement at PS/MS 124 emphasizes building a foundation of the dynamics of movement with the incorporation of spatial awareness, use of effort, shapes, and relationships between the dancers. As students move to the middle school level, there is the opportunity to work collaboratively with their peers in dancemaking, aligning the learning process with the Blueprint in Dance.",,Alexis O'Connor,Art Teacher,aoconnor2@schools.nyc.gov

Students are exposed to career-building skills in arts-related fields and gain an appreciation of art as a means of expression. By infusing the arts with technology, we provide students with an arts curriculum that is challenging as well as rigorous. Students are supported to apply knowledge and skills learned in the arts to make connections to the world around them. Our arts curriculum supports goal setting, prioritizing, and strengthening interpersonal skills by working collaboratively with peers, working independently, and continuing to align and support the Blue Print for Arts, Music and Dance. We put great emphasis on literacy in the arts and these skills support interdisciplinary units of study. This year, we were fortunate to have two of our students selected to participate in the Queens Boro Arts Fair, and an 8th grade student receive the 2018 Dr. Dolores Beckham Arts Award.  For the second consecutive year, we had the extreme pleasure of being the host school for New York State Music Association Adjudication.

The Performing Arts Department has grown exponentially through the guidance of our new teachers and residencies. Representatives from the Arthur Miller Foundation, Puppetry in Practice, Dance Theatre of Harlem and Roundabout Theatre have taught our students strategies to reduce stage fright and public speaking resulting in a noticeable improvement in pride, confidence and academic performance.  The field trip to Broadway (Anastasia) has motivated our performers. It was the first Broadway show for many of our students.  Administration has reserved a portion of what the budget allows however, following our Winter Festival of the Arts parents, local businesses and support groups have made donations ranging from costumes and props to their time.  Unfortunately, good equipment is not inexpensive.  We were able to purchase wireless microphones as our first major investment.  Proceeds from future performances can perhaps assist in our next purchase like floating mirrors, new curtains or an HD camera!  Our music teacher has begun to network in hopes of leasing, buying or fixing our aging instruments.  Years ago, this conversation was never initiated, now we have a wish list.

Our visual arts program supports individual interpretation of ideas and feelings while providing opportunities for experimentation in a variety of media, such as painting, drawing, printmaking, collage, sculpture, 2D/graphic design and digital media. Our art teacher nurtures our children's curiosity by encouraging our students to explore and express their individual interpretations of artwork.

Drama at Kappa Vi focuses on specific areas. These areas are: creating original student compositions, creating parodies/satires, folklore play-ons, as well as analyzing how art imitates life. Students participate in a large production at the end of each semester where all of these art-forms are highlighted. For all three years, students are broken into groups, where they create and perform on a daily basis. Instrumental music at Kappa Vi allows students to actively participate in a concert band setting. In the sixth grade, students have the choice of picking their own instrument, learning the responsibilities that pertain, and the responsibility of mastering the basics and beyond.

With the addition of an new and experienced music teacher, the music program at HCMS is flourishing.  There is currently an advanced chorus, a 6th grade chorus, a 7th grade chorus, a drum/percussion class, guitar class, and an 8th grade band.

Through the Design Academy that students may enter in the 10th grade, students take three full years of art courses that prepare them for the NYC Comprehensive exam in the Arts, the completion of a varied portfolio and the potential of a Special Arts Recognition on their diploma.  Artists at Richmond Hill High School exhibit their art at our school-wide arts fair or as winners of citywide art contests.  Past winners have had their artwork put on display in places of distinction throughout the city including The Queens Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 
The music classes at Richmond Hill High School provide students with the chance to explore music making through classes in percussion and through the use of music composition software.  In the percussion classes, students explore rhythm and ensemble communication in preparation for the 2 concerts the school celebrates each term.  Students of all levels will perform for an audience in their first semester.  The music composition classes ask students to mix and blend sounds to create a theme-based sound.  One project, for example, asks that students compose a new musical theme for known television trailer.  Students become proficient in the professionally recognized Ableton Live music software.

The theater classes at RHHS allow students to experience all aspects of putting on a performance including writing, acting and staging.

The arts (visual, music, theater and dance) are brought to life by classroom teachers each month, as different grade levels present what they have learned with a performance in the auditorium that encompasses singing, dancing, acting, and set/prop design.  Our staff engages all scholars with the various arts as they firmly believe it plays a vital role in the improvement of a scholars' academic achievements and the development of their social skills. Our scholars' education is extended beyond our doors as they take  field trips to various places where they are embraced by the arts and our doors are always open to the strong partnerships of our visiting artists.
	The visual arts program is offered to all grades levels, pre-K to 5th grade.  Scholars are enriched with rigorous lessons that focus on building art skills and techniques, learning about the art that surrounds them and the vocabulary that is used when speaking about art.  It is important that scholars can not only express themselves through the creation of art but that they can discuss and appreciate their own art, and the art of others, using the language of art.  Honing these skills provides confidence and further engagement which can play an integral role in transforming all classrooms into functioning art spaces.

Our focus is to mesh our students’ cultural knowledge and background into our arts program; thus allowing our students to develop positive attitudes towards self, others, and the community. Additionally, we would like to increase our association with cultural arts organizations with a focus on dance.

In our program, students are engaged in role playing, skit writing and performance of some of our favorite stories. We also use technology to share our understanding of important concepts through the use of computers and art based software such as iMovie. We provide a centers based approach to learning for all students where classroom teachers and teachers of the arts work collaboratively in a projects based learning environment. Students can then make clear connections to the curriculum and generate a strong understanding of the ""big ideas"" we study. Our communication through the Arts program provides students with the opportunity to engage in visual arts, learn about different types of styles from famous and accomplished artists,art elements and principles through multiple modalities. Our teachers provide all students with the opportunity to write and perform their own pieces of drama. We make continuous effort to expose students to different performances offered in New York City,we invite performance artists and authors into our school to share their craft with students, as well as observing theater based performances as well. We strive to create global learners for the 21st century.","Our students that are in grades Pre-K to 5th,  are a diverse and energetic mix of kids from various ethnic groups that display interest in all aspects of visual arts. Our school community is located in a low socio-economic area of South Richmond Hill, NY. There aren’t any places for kids to experience art. Many of our students are ENL, special needs or new immigrants. The families of these students lack the means to take advantage of the culture in NYC. Many of the parents work more than one job and/or do not speak English. This makes it hard for them to take their children to museums, book signings or meet/greets for authors, theaters and other visual art experiences.  The parents and the students appreciate the culture and experiences that will last a lifetime that is provided by our school community.

We have a new dance teacher added to our table of organization this school year and have been able to coordinate with different organizations, in an effort to advance the quantity and quality of arts instruction provide to our students. We write grants, reach out to our local politicians and look to resources available in the community to allow the opportunity to expose students to ballet, theater, chorus and other forms of dance. We aim to continue to build relationships with organizations such as Marquis Studios, JCAL and Lincoln Theater, in an effort to further our arts exposure. 
We are fortunate enough to have classroom teachers who are very artistic, and we worked collaboratively as a school to incorporate art into our curriculum. Some of the ways in which we do this is by having monthly themes, door contest and other events which allow students to promote their artistic abilities and enhance the school environment. Our English Language Learners have an art program imbedded into their Saturday program, in which they learn about different artist and then replicate some of their famous pieces. 
The ARTs are important to us at the PS82 school community and we treat as a language, which allows children to express themselves.

(To be published in Arts Report)

In the 2017-2018 school year we have provided all students in grades pre-kindergarten through grade five with many opportunities in the arts. All of our students received a class in visual arts and music. Learning experiences included playing instruments such as the recorders and the drums in addition to performing a variety of showcases. The students put on several performances throughout the school year. In our arts class the students are exposed to a variety of materials, techniques, learn about different styles of art and write about their art work using academic vocabulary to enrich their writing pieces. In our continued partnership with Marquis Studio the students used technology to create architectural forms. Our goal for next year is to expand our arts program, integrating the arts with science and social studies through project based learning activities.  This year 1017-2018 we were able to hire a part time music teacher to teach students in grade Three through Five, how to read music and  expand our instrumental music program. Next year we look forward to hiring a dance instructor to support students from different ethnic backgrounds. This teacher would teach students how to share their culture through physical movement.
","At P.S. 140 Queens- The Magnet School of Science, Technology and the Arts is composed of approximately 470 students. The students come from various ethnic backgrounds such as  Africans Americans, Hispanic,  and Asians. Recently our school was awarded a Magnet Grant in order to change the demographics of our school. In 2017 the students designed the new playground by drawing and creating scales.Already this year, our students were involved in Project Based Learning  in  which the students are  involved in developing   Projects which will teach and present ways to preserve the new playground.",Eartha Pruitt,Assistant principal,epruitt@schools.nyc.gov

We believe that the arts are an integral part of learning and through these interdisciplinary experiences, children develop their creativity, learn problem solving skills and become critical thinkers. The art teacher specialists provide instruction in artmaking and skill development. Our strong collaborations with our cultural organization partners like the Guggenheim Museum and the Queens Museum of Art have helped us build meaningful arts curriculum that is reflected in classroom practice.Through residencies, performances, museum visits and workshops, students, teachers and families are immersed in exciting arts experiences throughout New York City. ","As our school population grows, and we look forward to the future expansion of our building now in progress, we hope to build on our existing foundation of quality arts programs.

Students create and conduct their own investigations, analyze data and draw conclusions. Culminating activities mirror productions in theater, dance, architecture, engineering and music. The students are given many opportunities to showcase their artistic talents. The children, along with the visual arts specialist, designed and implemented a museum featuring their artwork in the school cafeteria. With the music specialist, students in first and second grade learned to play the piano, with a culminating recital at the end of second grade. Students in grade three learned to play the recorder while students in grades four and five learned the ukulele through individualized programs that encourage peer instruction. The dance specialist worked with all grades introducing multicultural dance styles. Ongoing relationships with skilled artists and musicians enable students to become artistic and independent critical thinkers. The Magnet Program, through collaborations with organizations such as the Turtle Bay Music School, Dancing Classrooms, Midori, Alvin Ailey’s Arts in Education and Community Programs, taps the rich resources in New York City to bring in-depth experiences that are not available elsewhere. Arts instruction at P.S. 160 is delivered through discrete classes conducted by musicians, dancers and licensed teachers who are specialists in the arts. At the same time, the arts are integrated into thematic units across the curriculum.",,Judy Silverman,Arts Liaison,jsilverman3@schools.nyc.gov

With this in mind, we have adjusted our curriculum to include singing, dancing, performing, and the visual arts.

Various funding sources support in school Arts Residency programs.  Mark DeGarmo Dance Studio facilitated dance for all identified English Language Learners students and Students with Disabilities.  All kindergarten and first grade students participated in New York Pops.  Participation included ""Kids in the Balcony"" and ""Kids in the Stadium"" programs. Jazz at Lincoln Center integrated grade four social studies with music.  Dancing Classrooms introduced formal ballroom dancing to all grade five students.  A third grade class participated in the Morgan Library Book Making Project. All third graders participated in the Marquis Studio African Market Place Project. All fourth graders played recorders. Cool Culture Family Program supported adults and children in exploring ninety New York City cultural venues.  A fourth grade class participated in the Rubin Museum Mandala project. In fall 2018 our school will receive a Sing for Hope Piano. Thirty students participated in CASA Musical Theater After School.  ","Our school is diverse in student population and staff members who support all students.  Our school does not qualify for Title 1 funds.  

Dance. theater art and museum programs are provided by cultural arts residency program teaching artists.  

Field trip content and concepts are integrated into the curriculum to support multiple entry points for all students.  Field trip admission costs are a burden.  

All students would benefit from centrally funded certified arts teachers along with visual arts, vocal music, dance, theater, and instrumental music residency programs. 

Central funded teachers should also include ""Literacy K-2"", ""Computers for All"" and ""Algebra for All.""

Staff members will continue to apply for Grants and Foundation Programs.

Like literacy and mathematics arts education is vital for all students.

Our role and responsibility as educators is to prepare students to be life long learners who are healthy, happy and productive citizens.

As such, we believe that the arts are essential to meeting these goals. 


We offer Music, Art and Drama on both the middle and high school level. Our curriculum emphasizes the freedom to create, discover, self-express, and work in collaboration through direct engagement in arts making. In addition, we seek to explore the full contextual role of the arts as a societal mirror both historically and today. Our ideal is to make participation in the arts a meaning making process that may lead to vibrant life-long cultural participation. 

At YECA our arts programs act as builders of culture and community imbuing our halls with the energy of self-reliance, creativity and discovery that makes the arts so valuable.",,Luke Manas,Arts Liaison ,lmanas2@schools.nyc.gov

The main goal of our program is to give the students the basic tools that they need to create great personal works of art and strive to grow as an artist. An important part of this is to keep students interested by molding the projects we do to the interests of the majority of the students, while also keeping the principles of design and basic skills frimley in place. 
Our art program covers the foundation of art with a Drawing unit, Color Unit and a Painting unit. With our drawing unit we go over the basics of line but reach the technique of drawing in 3D.  In our color unit we touch on the basics of color but also dive into the realm of optical illusions. Our Painting unit focuses on learning how paint works together and how to paint in a certain style. After completion, some of the best or most improved art students finish will be hung in the hallway and some will be hung within the main office. 
Fluidity is important in the production of art, the same can be said about the curriculum the students must follow. In order to keep them enthralled with the creation of artwork the curriculum would be well to do to change if necessary or to alter a project to fit the students better. We don't want art to be stale, it needs to be able to meet the needs of its audience and those needs are ever changing and growing in a middle school setting.",,Tyler Kundler,Visual Arts Teacher,TKundler@schools.nyc.gov

The implementation of various art clubs provide enrichment to selected students in second through fifth grade. Field trips and assemblies are used to integrate all four art forms into the students' learning experiences. The Blueprint for Teaching and Learning the Arts is used to guide the implementation of the instructional art program. An interdisciplinary approach to teaching the arts focuses on literacy through social studies connections, self expression and talent development. Students are encouraged to use the arts to understand historical context and study cultural diversity. Students utilize artistic expression and their imagination to practice their skills as speakers, listeners, writers, designers, visual artists, actors, singers, dancers, researchers, critics and collaborators. Parents are invited to participate in art workshops and museum trips.

The arts provide an avenue that allows children to express themselves creatively and lift their self-esteem. Our goal is to help students become more knowledgeable in the four arts disciplines. Through visual arts, music, dance, and theater, students use their imagination make decisions, problem solve, and work cooperatively together in groups. Hands-on learning experiences teach students to make social, cultural and historical connections.

Our school continues its partnership with Lincoln Center to provide students with engagement in the arts via residencies with teaching artists at our school in music, drama/theater, dance and visual arts.

     Students have continued to visit important museums, Grades 2- 
 5 traveling to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The New York Historical Society,as well as The Museum of Modern Art, all providing enriching and cultural experiences that are addressed in lesson planning. Students often recognize work they have seen in these museums in books and internet programs presented.
     Art work has been submitted to a variety of exhibitions, including the PS 2018 Art Show, The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 2018 Annual Art Exhibition, The  Queens Borough Arts Festival, The Disability Pride Parade Visual Art Contest, as well as the 2018 Energy Conservation Program. One fifth grade student was chosen as a semi-finalist for the PS Show, as well as another fifth grader chosen as a finalist for the Queens Museum Exhibition.
     Students continue to develop their artistic skills, utilizing drawing, painting, and sculpture materials. Lesson plans align with the NYC Blueprint for the Visual Arts. Skills continue to develop as students reach benchmarks described within the Blueprint.
     Our school has begun a partnership, working with the NYC Future Arts Initiative.This will continue into the 2018-2019 school year.

For the visual arts, we have an Art cluster teacher, who teaches art history along with various styles of sketching, drawing, painting and multimedia works.   Additionally, we have a partnership with the L.E.A.P program, which provides a year long series of workshops for parents and students to teach scrapbooking and quilt making.  

In the performing arts, our dance teacher works with students throughout the year to teach Jazz, African, and Modern dance techniques.   We also have a partnership with Ballet Tech for some of our students to learn ballet techniques. The LEAP program has a drama component as well, and a teacher worked with our students to create a short literacy based play.   We also have residencies with Elite Marching Band and Make Music Count for our students to learn how to play instruments including drums, trumpets, piano and more.

In addition, to instrument instruction, children also learned to read music, sing and play rhythms using percussion instruments. During our school year we hold several exhibitions where the children are able to perform at assemblies for their peers, parents, family and friends. Each grade also performs an assembly during their assigned month that includes acting, singing and dancing. Our intended goals are to teach our children to develop an appreciation for the arts whether they are taking music, visual arts, media arts, dance and/or theater.
Furthermore, PS 181 has a theater program where the children are taught to sing, act and dance by performing Disney musicals . We are currently in our third year of participating in the Disney Musicals in Schools program. Students learn on stage as well as backstage components of running a full-length production.

Upper elementary students have the opportunity to learn guitar, keyboards, bass, drums or vocals by joining our Little Kids Rock program. Here, students receive small group instruction once per week and perform in several concerts throughout the school year.   

This year all fourth and fifth graders have weekly dance classes with a resident dance specialist from Ifeytayo Cultural Arts Facility. Students will perform what they have learned at our Community Fair On May 19th.    

We also have classes participating in Carnegie Hall's Musical Explorers and Linked-In programs. Here, classroom teachers are trained to teach students to sing and play the recorder. Students are taught a specific repertoire which culminates in an interactive field trip to Carnegie Hall. 

We also offer students Chorus and after school Step Dancing. These students also perform at several concerts throughout the school year.","Since many of our families can't afford private instruction in the arts like their counterparts in the the more affluent suburbs, It is imperative that funding and support for the arts be increased.

The film class taught our student how to develop, storyboard, film and edit original work.  In the past two years we have begun a musical theater program through an MTI (Music Theater International/Shubert Broadway Jr. grant.  This two year program is designed to assist PS/IS 208 in developing a sustainable, quality theater program.  It engage students in the joyful process of creating musical theater.  It foster a strong educational community as students, staff, and families all ""play a role"" in the process.  It also encourage the connection of arts programming to curriculum study in all content areas.  Our students performed Fame Jr., Willy Wonka Kids, Shrek Jr. and Hairspray Jr.  These performances allowed our students to tap into their creative side and express themselves in multiple ways.

In art, students examine both health and social issues from current events to create works to bring awareness of these issues to the attention of the public. Through real world applicable projects we create videos, comics, brochures, board games, and street art along with classical artistic skills such as drawing from observation. In music, our students examine the fundamentals of music theory while relating them to their favorite songs. Utilizing these skills students embark on learning how to play the piano while composing their own original song.

The Institute offers avenues for the study of art through our English, science, social studies and mathematics classes at each grade level through our interdisciplinary approach. From using art and engineering to craft their own designed objects in physics to building representation of bridges in geometry students are exposed to a variety of art forms. Artistic expression is also available to students through a variety of clubs, including art, photography, a dance team, and a step team.","The Institute strives to help each student attain an individualized education consistent with the values of leadership, scholarship, and service through building relationships between students, parents, staff, and community partners. Students become artists, historians, scientists, mathematicians, literary scholars, and health care workers by learning to do the work of these disciplines. Collaboration and teamwork are essential elements of an education at The Institute. The faculty works collaboratively to ensure that student needs are being met by constantly learning about the most effective types of instruction and supports to help students meet their learning goals.

The arts are an integral part of Public School/Intermediate School 268's curriculum. We strive to fully realize the goals and objectives of the Blueprint for the Arts and enrich the academic program. We meaningfully integrate the arts into all curriculum areas to enhance learning. Students in grades three through five have the opportunity to participate in the Creative Arts Team theater program.  Students in fourth and eighth grade participated in CAE's Arts Engage Initiative. This program uses drama to support the social studies curriculum.  Disney Musical in Schools has assisted us in creating a sustainable theater program. Visual Arts students had their artwork showcased at the Queens Borough Art Show. Students in grades four through eight had the opportunity to be part of the AMP UP NYC and Little Kids Rock Modern Band program. Dance students had the opportunity to perform at Queens Borough Art Show. Students in grades seven and eight are provided with opportunities to specialize in one art form. They are supported in creating portfolios and preparing for auditions if they are applying to a specialized art school.

Additionally, students receive Theatre Arts classes twice a week and dance classes three times per week and are given the opportunity to perform these culminating performance projects in school wide events.",,Sheri Novak,Teacher,snovak2@schools.nyc.gov

Students are proud to see their projects and art work adorning the walls as they transition through the building. 
Our music teacher Ms. Horry, has worked with a choir this year to unlock the singing talents of some of our students. Additionally, she was instrumental in getting the Sing for Hope company to donate a piano to our school decorated by the cast of the Broadway show Chicago. Ms. Horry also worked with our 8th graders to write their own song that they will perform during their graduation ceremony. 
Ms. Hunte volunteers her time to train a dance and drama team whose performances have gotten them invited to multiple venues in the district. She worked with other staff members and students to create an original script for Black History Month which was well received by the school community. 
Next year I would like our arts program to continue replicating the great things that they are doing. We plan on incorporating the arts when planning our project based learning units. In addition we would like our students to put on performances using the instruments that they practice on during music class. ",,Natale Quinonez,Art Teacher,cnatalequinonez2@schools.nyc.gov

The school has created partnerships with these organizations. In the past, artists had visit classrooms to discuss their art work. Students are continuing making connections with the socio-cultural and historical significance of theater. This year, Mathematics, Science Research and Technology High School's goals are to integrate arts into all content areas and create partnerships with various arts organizations to enrich the culture of our students.

In order to do this, students must be taught to refine their observation, develop problem–solving skills, build a more extensive visual vocabulary, read and write about art to reinforce literacy skills and interpret the arts through discussion. This is achieved through a differentiated and multi-sensory approach to learning. Not only do our classroom teachers teach various art forms throughout the year in content areas, we are also fortunate enough to have community-based arts partnerships as well. Another goal at P.S. 2Q is to continue the current partnerships, to expand the programs offered to include more students, and to add more variety to the programs offered. We were very grateful to provide multiple programs to our students this year, including visual arts instruction, dance, music, and dramatic arts. Through these partnerships we hope to offer students exposure to a variety of art forms and media through weekly sessions with resident artists, field trips and school art projects. Finally, we strive for our students to become lifelong learners and advocates for the arts.

Our students are engaged in multiple arts and enrichment activities that reflect our diverse and multicultural school community. Grants with our arts partner City Lore brought residencies in songwriting, African dance, music and visual arts to our students. Two CASA grants afforded students instruction in traditional Mexican dance and musical theater in after-school programs. Music grants enabled student participation in before and after school programs in addition to instruction already offered in guitar, string and wind instruments in Grades 3, 4 and 5. Our choral program continues to flourish, receiving top ratings at local festivals. Artist in Residence programs delivered direct arts instruction to our students while focusing on this year’s magnet theme of Africa and for next year, The Americas.  These residencies and music programs are celebrated, with our students and school community, through assemblies and performances all year long. We are a SEM school engaging in multiple enrichment opportunities through magnet or interest-based enrichment clusters in Grade 2, 4 and 5 while early childhood students receive arts instruction in our EaGLE program. We will continue our rich, successful cultural arts partnerships with City Lore, JALC, Dancing Classrooms, FTH, Inside Broadway and Joyce Theater. At PS 69Q, we believe that arts experiences and arts education are essential to educating the whole student to reach their full potential. ","At P.S. 69Q, we strive for an instructionally focused learning environment emphasizing our multicultural and diverse background of 1,046 students who have 24 different home languages and cultures. We are ""The School of Cultural and Performing Arts"" and endeavor to offer as many arts experiences to our students as possible. We believe that the arts play a vital role in the development of our students not just academically but in their social and emotional growth as well. All students are encouraged to be meaningfully and thoughtfully engaged in academic, artistic, collaborative and socially conscious tasks where every student is accepted and honored for their accomplishments, potential and individuality.  We annually rotate our magnet theme between Asia, Africa and the Americas, integrating these themes throughout our arts curriculum, residency programs, cultural events, multiple school music celebrations and performances while making connections to our students own varied unique cultural experiences.

The program is sequentially developed on disciplined based art education and is aligned with the New York City Blueprint For Teaching and Learning in Visual Arts and the Common Core Standards. Art concepts are taught through activities based on the elements of design: line, shape, form, texture, space, color and value. Art instruction lends itself to integrating with other subject areas. The purposes of these activities are to help students develop awareness of, and appreciation for, the skills in communicating through art, and a feeling of pride and satisfaction in their work. Multicultural art activities are infused into the curriculum. Art in the elementary school gives students the opportunity to develop an interest in art appreciation and to develop critical and creative thinking skills. Our music program, which also follows the standards, provides an opportunity for all students to receive a comprehensive performance-based music education. Through the study of a wide range of music literature students can become intelligent consumers, producers, and/or creators of music. The high level of motivation required for performance courses is an invaluable asset to educational growth. School performances contribute to developing a sense of responsibility in students.",,Sophia Mavromatis and Donna c. Geller,Art Teacher and Liaison and Principal,dgeller@schools.nyc.gov

As a Community School we have a number of partnerships with arts and media institutions such as Studio In A School, The Museum of the Moving Image, Community Word Project Broadway Jr. and Lincoln Center Education. Funding for Alvin Ailey is provided by City Council member Jimmy Van Bramer. Scholars Pre-K-8 also receive music instruction by a full time music teacher.This year we are also putting on a spring theater production of Annie Jr. through our partnership with Broadway Junior. Art and music lunchtime clubs also are implemented weekly.","At Community School 111 Q We also recognize the importance of the Arts in making our scholars “College and Career Ready!” This year our scholars will perform Annie Junior on June 4, 2018 at 5:00pm.  The partnership with Broadway Junior has taught our scholars self-esteem, the power of speech and projection and the necessary social characteristics to be successful in the ever demanding work force. During the play the scholars dazzle us with several choreographed and vocal performances. The depth of their character and commitment to the team is profound. Our music teacher, ENL teacher, librarian, and Art teacher make this miracle a reality for our scholars!

Other performances included the Art and Peace Dance performances through our Collaboration with Alvin Ailey. Many connections are made back to academics through art. Art is valued at our school.",Gabriella Giaconia,Visual Arts Teacher,ggiacoia@schools.nyc.gov

Our middle school has a talent show to showcase talent in the arts. In addition, students participate in a club of their choice, including dance, music, and fine arts. Parents are partners in the arts and participate in art education workshops and events. Families are invited to attend school concerts, events, Family Night, Hobby Night, Dance Festival, Culture Night, and art trips. Students and families are given free passes to the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City. Students who participate in American Ballroom Theater in fifth grade are given an opportunity to continue dance instruction in Manhattan for a nominal fee. An event was sponsored for cultural organizations to introduce their programs and encourage family participation. Free passes to museums were given to families who attended the workshop.

At Public School 152 the arts are weaved into each daily instructional experience. We provide our students with in-house arts instruction consisting of music, theater, and visual arts provided by licensed teachers on staff, and artists in residence from arts organizations and trips to enhance the Arts experience. In house residencies include 10 - 12-week cycles provided via our partnership with Marquis Studios to children in kindergarten through fifth grade and a second collaboration with Dancing Classrooms offered to our fifth graders. Arts instruction includes movement and expressive theater for all of our students. Additionally, the following arts programs are provided: Percussion to Grade 3, Islamic Arts studies to Grades 4; Visual Arts (Origami) to Grade 4; Photography and Ballroom Dancing to Grade 5. This year we added a script-writing residency after school with funds from CASA grant. Students worked with residents after school to write original plays that were later performed by actors from the Astoria Performing Arts Center for a selected audience. Additionally, during Parent Night in May the parents participate in Parent-child Arts workshops where students use the skills learned with each residency to teach their parents. Events include origami, painting, drawing, tissue paper art and more. 

The Arts will continue to be the forum to build emotional maturity, physical development, and social awareness.",,Enid Maldonado-Salgado,Assistant Principal,emaldon3@schools.nyc.gov

Selected students participated in the Ezra Jack Keats Bookmaking Competition, which enabled them to create their own picture books. Studio in a School worked with students to enable them to learn about nutrition, while incorporating visual arts. Art House Astoria worked alongside classroom teachers to deliver in-class music instruction. Town Hall worked with the certain grades to learn ballroom dancing, creative movement, and hip hop routines and to choreograph original moves. We also have an ongoing partnership with Ballet Tech, which students audition for and are selected to participate in an ongoing study of the art of ballet. Lastly, Kidspire works with the younger grades to learn the basics of architectural design. Additionally, our music and art teachers work with the students to put on countless performances and concerts for school and families. The upper grades have the opportunity to participate in chorus, which also contributes to yearly concerts and events.

All fifth grade students learn the recorder, sing folk songs from around the world, often celebrating their ancestral heritage, and apply movement to their music making. Sixth graders have a number of options that prepare them for continued study in seventh through eighth grade. In general music, students continue using the mallet percussion and drums while learning basic music theory and solfeggio. In the ensembles; chorus, band and orchestra, students learn how to read music and apply musical notation to a number of genres from the Baroque era to popular music. It is the mission of the Arts department to teach students to be life-long learners. Much emphasis is placed upon working towards preparing students for performing arts high schools and to become career-ready in Arts related subjects. In our art classes, we enable students to use a variety of processes to stimulate creative ideas, manipulatives, and self-determined learning. Students explore many mediums including ceramics in preparing their portfolios for specialized high school auditions. Art classes are actively engaged in using self and peer-assessment to promote growth and revision within their projects. Art students adhere to lessons aligned with the NYC Blueprint while exploring contemporary movements in the art world today. Self-contained classes enjoy differentiated art experiences. All students celebrate yearly in the Art Show.

Our school now boasts a dressing room complete with costumes, wigs, make-up, and more. We have received a moveable spotlight and wireless headset microphones. The confidence of our students has grown tenfold, allowing us to take our performances “on the road”. Part of our initiative has been to share our performances with other schools in our immediate area. These shared performances have increased the camaraderie among our fellow district 30 schools and added to our students’ confidence, which we are always trying to build.

Students partake in a variety of projects that allow them to acquire English language skills through the arts. Teachers infuse the arts into their lessons by providing students with opportunities to develop their innate talents through class projects and group assignments. This year C.A.S.A. and S.A.S.F. provided visual arts and theatre to our students in after school programs. We also provided visual arts to 85% of the students through an F-Status art teacher. Students also created art pieces that were displayed in a NYC Lunar New Year Scroll that was exhibited at the David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center. All art projects were displayed during the school's Annual Art Fair. Students wrote and produced a play with C.A.S.A., that was performed at Queens Theater in the Park.","Due to budget constraints, we are unable to provide a full time art teacher.  Through the generosity of the F-Status Arts Teacher Pilot program we have been able to offer art to more than 80% of our students. It would be ideal, if we could provide our entire student population with an arts class.
Many of our students have artistic talents and abilities. In November 2017 one of our 8th grade students won the Respect for All poster contest in District 30.  She received recognition from the Superintendent and Council Member Daniel Dromm. She was also recognized at the Annual City-wide Respect For All Ceremony.  
The arts are a universal language. Students with limited English skills are able to express themselves freely and without fear. It would be wonderful if we were able to offer it year round. ",Evelyn Gomez,Arts Liaison,egomez5@schools.nyc.gov

In addition to integrating arts into the classroom curriculum through lyrics study, classical music study, and painting study, our students receive arts instruction during the school day during music and visual arts classes. Furthermore, we offer a variety of arts based clubs that meet after school and on the weekend for arts enrichment, practice, and exposure. We also host residencies from arts organizations that help deepen student understanding of a variety of art forms and cultures. Our school strives to reflect and improve our arts integration and programs to align to common branch curricula, include community members, and further develop student understanding of visual arts, music, theater, and dance. 

Visual arts classes at our school are student centered and focused on project based learning. The students also learn about artists, art history, and the principles and elements of art and design. Computer Science is also integrated into visual arts classes through coding, stop motion and robotics.

Our Core music program uses multiple approaches to engage students in active music learning. These approaches build musicianship through singing, speech, movement, and instrument playing. Students have the opportunity to improvise, create, explore, label, imitate, and express themselves through music. ",,Dara Coppolone,Music Teacher,dcoppolone@schools.nyc.gov

Our arts curriculum is aligned to the New York City Blueprints for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and our school's approach to arts learning also reflects our school's three performance outcomes: critical thinking skills, creativity in problem-solving, and communication skills. In the context of arts learning, critical thinking skills are evidenced by the ability to interpret and analyze works of art across a variety of genres, styles, and artistic traditions; creativity in problem solving is evidenced by the ability to create original works of art through the intentional application of emerging artistic skills and concepts; communication skills are evidenced by the ability to present works of art (e.g., in gallery exhibitions or musical performances) and justify artistic decisions orally and in writing. In all arts areas, we are working to promote the development of critical thinking skills, creativity in problem solving, and communication skills through students' learning experiences in the arts.

Student artwork was selected as winners for contests such as Online Safety, Respect For All, and Sustainability.

We have integrated other residencies throughout our history, and currently partner with ArtsConnection to provide a supplementary theater program for our students.  We continue to spiral the four arts disciplines throughout the grades.  This is accomplished via a combination of cluster programming, Junior and PBIS assemblies, field trips, visiting cultural institutions, classroom instruction, and the aforementioned residencies.  

This year, we received a NYCDOE Family Engagement grant, which enabled us to integrate parents within the context of our visual arts instruction.  We aspire to expand this program in the future, as indicated in our CEP; we will utilize art as a catalyst for community involvement.  It is our intention to solidify intergenerational bonds with the Kivlehan Chapter of the Korean War Veterans, whose presence is an integral component of our school identity.  We honor them annually during an arts-oriented Flag Day ceremony, where our students explore patriotism, civic responsibility, and the joys of creative expression.  We are inestimably proud of the artistic identity that PS 6 has forged, and will continue to meld arts instruction with multifaceted components of our curricula.",,Renee Esposito,Arts Liaison / Performing Arts Director,REsposi4@schools.nyc.gov

The goals of the Arts program include multiple opportunities to experience a variety of musical, visual arts, dance, and theater presentations as expressions of voice, culture and points of view. Students also share and learn about their own culture and personal histories through the arts during our 'Culture Day' Celebration. Exposure to the Arts provide students with expanded awareness of multiple interpretations of events/representations and develop appreciation of same. We also have a  Chorus which provides fourth and fifth grade students with the experience of learning two and three part harmony, working within a cooperative group, building relationships, analyzing songs for musical elements as well as meaning and to meet and perform with top performers in the field. Singer/performers such as Leslie Odom of the play Hamilton came to PS 22 to sing with the students. Students have had past performances such as singing at the Oscars, singing at the Presidential Inauguration of President Obama and other experiences. Our young artists have created a gallery presentation that adorns the school hallways and have created poems to accompany their work.  The overarching goal of these programs is to give students a well rounded foundational education which enhances or further develops their academic and personal growth. We hold the Arts in high regard and are committed to providing quality programs to our students.

When visiting our school you will find that we have been successful in reaching our past goals in transforming public space (halls, cafeteria, school yard walls, classroom doors) into lasting pieces of student artwork. Both the interior and exterior walls become student canvases, as individual art work is permanently fixed on the walls throughout the campus. 

As part of our goal to maintain our arts education programs, in September 2017 we implemented individualized programming for the incoming sixth grade.  In 2018 we will add a new dance program to be part of the talent selection choices for students. With a wider selection of art programs to choose from, we believe we will provide a stronger possibility of students being placed in an arts education program that best fit their interests.

In music, students play individually and as an ensemble and learn to critique as well as assess self and peer performances. Students learn to connect sounds and symbols and the year culminates with performances. The music department includes instruction in band, jazz band, rock bank, and  recorder as well as Music Memory and rhythm and movement.

Students in our Music Program are exposed to performing professionals, which enhances their musical experience.  From time to time, Artists in Residence are brought into classrooms via SKYPE lessons and in person. Through our Sophomore Poetry Project, students wrote, recited and dramatically performed their very own poetry compositions on the stage as part of our Poetry Slam.  Other outlets for artistic expression and performance can be seen in our talent show production, which incorporates music, dance, drama and vocal performances. Through our Senior Capstone Fair, students utilize the Arts to spread global competence and take community action to address a societal or international dilemma.

Our school is a choice school providing families around Staten Island (and all of NYC) an opportunity to apply to a school with new ideas around education.

We have formed partnerships with programs such as Historic Richmond Town, Staten Island Children’s Museums, Snug Harbor Cultural Center, The Noble Maritime Collection, Billion Oyster Project and many more to name a few. 

Our commitment to the arts is very evident in the work in which we engaged in and in the partnerships we create. We have our own art and drama teacher. In addition we collaborated with Sundog Theatre, Cumbe African Dance, Salvadori and Illuminart, who provided our students with in-school residencies.

In addition, to best support a curriculum where the instructional focus is based on an inquiry and project-based approach, teachers have blocks of time where they can fully engage in the depth of the work. The afternoon arts block provides students the opportunity to develop an appreciation for the arts, be art literate and connect the arts to the social context in which their grade focuses on (self, neighborhood, etc.. Using the Seven Guiding Principles for the Arts developed by David Coleman, students study current art, art history, how art impacts current society and explore a variety of tools, mediums and genres.

The curriculum is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards as well as the NYC Blueprint for the Arts. During this time students were made aware of the standards, were given opportunities to self-assess, peer-assess and create goals so that they can take ownership of their learning. Students also received visual arts, dance and theater instruction in the classroom. Creative dance movement blends movement, music, improvisation,and basic dance steps while providing an excellent introduction for the future of all dance techniques. What they learn through both classroom and out of classroom instruction is then showcased for parents through annual performances. This year our pre-k sites participated in the NYC Pre-K Create track. Visual arts, dance, theater, and music were incorporated into ongoing instruction to promote student learning in multiple Prekindergarten Foundation for the Common Core domains. Through professional development we learned new ways to design classroom learning centers so that art activities are integrated.  Additionally, we have partnered with our afterschool organization, NYCID, to extend the arts into afterschool hours.  This year students were offered a dance club, a visual arts club and a theater club.  All clubs were determined based upon parent surveys.","Although my Dance Teacher is not certified in dance she is a graduate of Dance Educators of America,has knowledge of the dance blueprint, professional development in the dance blue print,college credits and G Credits in dance and a Zumba Certification.

We instituted student workshops after working with Sundog Theatre, Inc. This year we were not given the grant for a resident visual artist as we had last year.  However, we worked tirelessly to fundraise in order to bring the program back and expand it. This allowed an even greater number of student visual artists to participate in classes for drawing, sketching, and photography under the tutelage of their advisor. Currently the visual arts program is an after-school club, but we have a great deal of talent in our school and would like to introduce the visual arts as a complete school curriculum. We are creative in utilizing our TV studio by allowing students hands-on experience when filming student productions. Core subject teachers continue to work with our TV studio teachers to have student presentations filmed and streamed throughout the building on the hallway televisions to better reach the student body with messages and spirited information. We continue to bring students to the opera, the ballet and Broadway to enhance their relationships with the arts. Each year we try to grow in new directions a bit more, taking full advantage of New York City and its cultural offerings.  Finally, as a  a specialized school that prides itself on a STEAM curriculum and CTE, teachers and students have paired with the CTE department in order to become a greater presence in our school's maker space.

We have purchased keyboards and percussion instruments to enhance the musical capabilities of our students during the school day. Teachers of the arts continue to be provided with professional development training throughout the school year, which enhances their knowledge and our arts programs. For the seventh year, Music and the Brain, in their early childhood keyboard program, has engaged our students in learning literature through song and play,. There is a strong family involvement component in which parents participate in cultural activities and engage in a variety of musical and artistic experiences. Our goal for the school year is to differentiate the arts learning for students of all grades. The Middle School Arts partnership has been extremely beneficial to our sixth through eighth grade students. During elective periods on Friday, students engage in chorus and dance.

We have two licensed art teachers in both visual arts and music, who continue to attend professional development to increase their knowledge in these areas in order to fully incorporate and embed the arts into our curriculum. Our goal of becoming a school of the arts, is partially based on the fact that a strong art curriculum, combined with content area subjects, enhances and improves student learning, and in some cases, has even helped in closing learning gaps; especially for English Language Learners and students with disabilities. This year we discovered that our ELL population is very talented in the area of visual arts and music, and we are proud of their accomplishments in these areas. We use the Blueprints for the Arts to guide our curriculum and instruction. We have dedicated space in our building to accommodate an art room and a music room housed with equipment such as instruments, smartboards, computers, and an abundance of art supplies. Our art teachers meet with teachers across disciplines and grades, to create interdisciplinary lessons. Our grant team  meets weekly to seek out grants and opportunities to provide funding for our arts program. This year we are proud to begin working in the new state of the art visual arts room that was provided to us through a city grant. The students are very excited about working in this new art lab.","The student population of PS 116 - Elizabeth L Farrell consists mostly of English Language Learners and former ELL's.  We have discovered through research, data and our own initiates that these type of students respond well and learn a great deal through the arts.  It is a universal way for them to express their ideas and have their individual talents shine.  This gives them confidence to tackle more challenging work and provides a foundation for which they can build upon. The correlations they make through visual arts and music helps these students with things such as phonics, vocabulary and reading comprehension.

This year we have included ukuleles in the music club. This year's visual arts students enjoyed the arts club. In the art club, students have experimented with different painting techniques. The students participated in a three-part educational program with MOMA, which allowed them to refine their critiquing and creating skills. Our 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students visited the MET. The students participated in contests, such as the Water Contest, Respect Contest, Black History Month, PS 1, and Brooklyn Art Festival. Our students' artwork is published on the internet website Artsonia, which is an online gallery where families can view their child's artwork. This year we commenced after-school programs in collaboration with Bronx Arts Ensemble, ASPIRA and LEAP.

Our school values creativity, imagination, self expression and the ability to apply knowledge across content areas. Students need these skills more than ever as they prepare for higher education and the work force. Our school cultivates these skills through arts instruction. Public School 274 collaborated with Brooklyn Academy of Music, New Victory Theater, Little Kids Rock, and Disney Musicals in Schools to include music, dance, theater and visual arts to enrich our curriculum. The Music and the Brain program gave kindergarteners and first graders the tools to learn to read music through classroom keyboard lessons.  Students in kindergarten and first grade finished the year with a piano recital for parents and faculty members.  In addition, Visual Thinking Strategy is implemented throughout our building to support our love for visual arts through rich discussion. All classes visit our art studio where the art teacher introduces different artists and their techniques, many times blending in themes that support the units of study in the classrooms. Student art work will be celebrated at a school-wide art exhibition at the end of May. Our after school program with Disney Musicals in schools offered a unique theater experience to students in grades 3-5, culminating in a performance of Lion King Kids at the end of May and a trip to perform one song from the musical on Broadway.

This year, one of our school's goals has been to continue to enrich and expand the performing & visual arts program within our school community. Given this focus, we have boosted our level of performance, and expanded both of our annual winter and spring concerts to encompass more diversity and theatrical elements. We also put together an elaborate production of the theatrical play, Peter & The Starcatcher, with full cast and crew! We have also expanded on our International Day celebrations to include more performance opportunities that highlight a variety of cultures. In addition, we have created partnerships with local arts educational programs to prepare our students with the foundation skills needed to succeed in these realms. Through these comprehensive programs, students learn valuable, life-long skills that are necessary to working in large and diverse groups. Additionally, they broaden the scope of our school community, allowing for teachers, students and parents to come together and acknowledge the hard work and diligence found within our performing and visual arts program.",,Mya James,Assistant Principal,Mjames3@schools.nyc.gov

Through the Arts Matter grant we provided Theater classes to our 6th, 7th and 8th grade students. We also integrated arts into our middle school advisory program. During Advisory middle school students have the opportunity to learn how to play the guitar and drums. For our 3-5 graders we offered after-school dance classes through FYRE Zone, and our middle school students can attend SASF after-school. We also started an Arts and Crafts after-school program on Fridays which is open to all students. 

Our goal for next year is to further integrate Arts in the content areas if we are awarded the LEAP grant. In addition, we are pursuing other ways to bring music into our middle school classrooms. ",,Claudia Harris,"Principal,IA",charris19@schools.nyc.gov

At present, four classes of Intro Art are taught, covering the 11th grade and most of the 10th grade (with a few 9th and 12th graders in each heterogeneous class).  Students who show interest, drive and ability are able to take AP Studio Art: Drawing in the following year (this will soon be a two-yr class, once Intro Art is moved fully to 10th Grade); students who are able to produce enough portfolio work will have their works submitted via AP exam.  This year, most of the AP class was seniors with only one year to produce 24 portfolio pieces, and the timeframe was too short for them to fulfill the exam requirements.  

Intro art is widely differentiated to meet the needs of students with very different levels of previous art exposure.  It's mostly project-based as a way of teaching artmaking skills while giving students agency and works they want to invest themselves in.  In the second semester, projects become longer-form and more intense (comics on Bristol, clay sculptures).  

AP art, after a few guided projects early in the year, runs on the Teaching Artistic Behavior model wherein the teacher helps each student create his or her own personally-planned work.  

Next year, I plan on AP class taking field trips to the Museum of Modern Art as a way to find inspiration and stake a personal claim in the arts institutions in NYC (too many students think it's inaccessible).  I hope to find more funding to allow more materials for all of my classes.",,William Wrigley,Art Teacher,wrnwrigley@gmail.com

Through visits from our arts partners, students are introduced to and develop an understanding of how the arts reflect diverse cultures of the past and present - through music, movement and visual arts such as painting, sculpture, printmaking and collage. Our collaboration with the arts organizations has led to an important kind of thinking which transfers to all areas for our students. These multisensory means of engagement are aligned with Common Core Learning Standards and the NYC Blueprint for the Arts. The arts have positively contributed to the social emotional and academic areas in each classroom. Thus, our students have exhibited increased respect for personal space, taking turns, listening and responding appropriately. Our visual arts units exemplify collaborative teamwork among students. The residencies have made a strong impact on our students by increasing peer to peer respect, building vocabulary and confidence to express themselves in a safe environment. In addition, through dance and rhythm, our students worked through impulse control, sequencing skills, following directions and socialization. The multisensory nature of the arts is vital to our students. We believe in the expressive, creative and therapeutic benefits of engaging through the arts.","Many of the questions related to exact numbers are very difficult to answer ,since our students population is transient and changes on a daily basis. Therefore, it is important to mention that the numbers reflect a snapshot of students, but do not truly reflect the attendance for a full school year. In addition, we do not have students for a full day in many sites so we must integrate the arts into other content areas to address all standards in a short amount of time. we greatly value the arts and appreciate what the arts budget affords for our special students.

Students in grades 3-5 and 8-12 participate in Little Kids Rock, a nationwide program which uses the “Music as a Second Language” pedagogical approach to involve students in creating music. Students learn guitar, bass, keyboards, and drums while playing contemporary and classic popular music. The emphasis is on getting students playing as quickly as possible and to integrate music theory as needed. This year, performed a H.E.L.P. Concert: Songs of Hope, Empowerment, Love, and Peace, inspired by the youth movements of the 1960s. 

Students also participated in the NYCDOE’s Digital Theatre Program. Through the Office of Arts and Special Project’s partnership with C&T Theatre in England, students used theater techniques to explore contemporary issues and shared their work with students from around NYC and the world. Students in grades 3-5 interviewed members of the community who had migration stories to tell, then they recreated these journeys in video vignettes, and shared their work, along with the work of other NYCDOE students and students from around the globe, on an interactive digital platform created by C&T Theatre, called PushPull.tech. Students also participated in online video chats with students in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Nairobi, Kenya. 

High school students earn credits for music, theater, and art that fulfill requirements for graduation.  ","Public School 23Q is a multi-site organization serving students in K-12th grade from all five boroughs. It is our belief that an effective arts program contributes to the emotional and educational well-being of the whole child. Our goal is to provide a basic foundation and appreciation of the arts and to have this foundation support other areas of instructional learning throughout the school day. Through the arts, we are able to reinforce content areas through hands-on project-based learning, increase self-esteem, develop social and self-advocacy skills, and improve team building while addressing the students' individual needs with regard to their various learning styles. 

As part of District 75’s initiative to promote Student Advocacy for students with disabilities, students in PS23Q learned about the history of the disability rights movement and created a plan to advocate for a need they determined needed addressing. High School classes at P23Q are creating a play that will shine a light on the nature of disabilities often overlooked in our society and the source of bullying for young people who live with them. The play, which integrates research, creative writing, and theater skits devised by students, educates others about 12 emotional disorders in an effort to increase understanding about the disorders and to decrease bullying that stems from ignorance. Students will perform the play at assemblies in general education schools in an on-going community service initiative. ",Tavia Trusch,Assistant Principal,Ttrusch@schools.nyc.gov

With financial and mentoring support from Marquis Studios, teaching artists from The Teaching Artist Training Institute have the opportunity to come to our school to learn about effective methods of working with students on the Autism Spectrum as well as students with other developmental disabilities.

Through the arts, we seek to address the varied learning modalities of our special needs students, in both standardized and alternate assessment, making powerful connections across the content areas. Recognizing the power of the arts to support our students' emotional and social growth, as well as academic growth, we continue to support Emotional Literacy in and through the various arts disciplines. To this end, we continuously strive to expand our programs, to partner with cultural organizations and to elevate the rigor of our arts instruction through cohorts and professional development. With an aggressive approach to grant writing, we constantly seek out opportunities for our students and we have been able to supplement our existing programs and to also bring in partner organizations. This past year we were fortunate to have the distinction of being recognized as a highlighted school in the annual Arts in Schools Report.  We hope to continue to live up to that honor and continue to grow.","Our D75 school currently serves students with disabilities in Pre-K through the 8th grade. Our students have multiple diagnoses, including Behaviorally Impaired, Downs Syndrome, and on the Autism Spectrum.  This year we expanded with the addition of a new co-located site at 31R006.  It has been an ongoing struggle to have equity of arts instruction across grades and sites, as we were in 7 buildings for the 2017-2018 academic year.  In September of 2018, we will be adding an 8th site, at 31R061.  As our enrollment continues to grow, we are spread across the length and width of Staten Island, making it difficult, not only financially, but logistically as well, to provide every student with even one art discipline delivered by a cultural partner and/or arts cluster.  Except for 8 classes, the remainder of visual arts is art on a cart, impacting 43 classrooms that are used for arts instruction (the survey caps at 25).  In many cases, due to a lack of art teachers on staff for so many locations, art instruction is delivered by the classroom teachers, for a total of 20 classes.  Additionally, co-locations pose the problem of competition for space for performances, practices and studio arts, etc.  As an example, one of our sites was forced to decline participation with the Disney in Schools program due to an inability to secure time for rehearsal and performance space.  Sadly, these programs, which have such an incredible impact on our students, often must be severely altered or cut due to constraints of space and finances.",Elena Seminara,Arts Education Liaison,Eseminara@schools.nyc.gov

Another class performed their own exciting version of Marc Anthony's ""Vivir Mi Vida"", which featured live keyboards, drums and vocals.  A third class also performed a salsa number ""La Gozadera"" by Gente de Zona, which featured student's dancing with Puerto Rican flags.  A fourth highlight was a bachata song ""Culpa al Corazon"" by Prince Royce, performed by a class featuring their percussion ensemble.  Our show, Music Through The Years, featured songs from the 1950's to present day including: Elvis, The Temptations, Jackson 5, Prince, Madonna, Queen, and Adele.  One highlight was a student performing solo piano to Michael Jackson's ""Billy Jean.""  Another highlight of the show was a duo singing Adele's ""Someone Like You.""

Our arts programming celebrates our students' unique talents and provides opportunities to celebrate their individuality. Our young artists have physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, learning impairments and autism spectrum disorders.  The arts programming incorporates the New York City Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, aligns with New York State Arts Standards, and Common Core Learning Standards.  The curriculum is differentiated to meet the needs of our students' diverse learning styles and ability levels.  We support our students and their journey to gain independence, self-confidence, and daily living skills. 
  Next year we hope to better create a learning environment that addresses the unique needs of our students with multiple disabilities.  We aim to make the art rooms more accessible and less distracting to increase student participation, focus and achievement.  We aim to do this by adding appropriate tables that are adapted for wheelchair users, visual arts storage and other adaptive equipment that are suitable for our students.",,Lisa Currie,Arts Education Liaison,lcurrie2@schools.nyc.gov
